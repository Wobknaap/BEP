So, after 3 months of not being around, the boy (myself) had finally returned to the city. Of course she played it cool and acted as if nothing happened but I just kept gathering my information on the low.

We first identified that in our team we had a few of our team members that actually had a good following on social media and whomst we can use for this project. This would save us a lot of time. But what we didn't realise was, apart from the few people we had recognised being employees of this organisation, they were their own bosses when it comes to social media work. And sadly they did not disclose that at first. Once we had done all the preps, I was handed a bunch of invoices from people we thought would be doing the work as employees. To my suprise when I took the invoice to our manager, the project did not have a budget for this and we had to miss the deadline for our project because of bad organisation and lack of transparency.",0,Deceptive,0.88076603,False

He made his first move by sending me coffee and cake. I then sent him a letter saying thank you with a home cooked meal. He then asked if we could meet up. He kept postponing and I got mad and thought why would he even do the things he does, like send me flowers and food everyday and not want to meet me in person. Eventually we met in person and we both fell in love and we have been together ever since. We had lots of difficulties as I was still in a relationship and living with my partner and this in turn resulted in all our fights stemming from that.
We did adult things everytime we saw each other and the more we were intimate the more he insisted I let go of the person I was with.
It was difficult, up until now, he is still in my life and we have agreed to be friends with benefits. We both dont want to lose each other but I feel like we will lose each other soon and maybe if he lets me go thats when I can finally focus on my relationship.",0,Truthful,0.5623592,True

Anthony did all the talking basically and explained from the beginning what was happening and why it was happening. He basically explained that the project was not making money and because of that almost everyone would be let go. 

He also proceeded to say this wasn´t the end and that the project would continue as some members would acquire the project and still work on it. 

Was a pretty dry reunion for the occasion to be honest. I already this would happen so it didn´t strike me right away, although it was awful as I loved the job and it was paid very very well.

However, I wasn't too worried and was just really relieved that the cancerous growth had been found early before it had time to spread, and I wanted it removed asap. The surgeon takes it out with wide margins to avoid any spreading so its quite a big portion of tissue that is removed compared to normal skin lesion removal. The operation went very well, and afterwards it was quite tender and sore at the wound site. However, within a couple of days I had almost forgotten about it.

We were assigned to a client to audit for the duration of 3 weeks. the deadline was tight due to the amount of work that needed to be done within the 3 weeks period.

As a result of not following up i found out towards the end of the audit that the feedback given to me was not accurate or was not a true reflection of the job done.
We ended up asking the client for additional time in order to finalize our audit and this resulted to me as a senior having to take responsibility for everyone's fault. I was ask to explain to the manager and the partner on the job. this took about 2 hours explaining what went wrong.

Who was involved:
It was me and the two junior audit assistance on the job. the manager and the partner were just the to supervise and sign off on the financials once the audit is completed.

Self sabotage came into play a little and full of nervousness I didn't share the news with anybody, I even attempted to delete the invite a few times in an attempt to play ""out of sight out of mind"" However I knew it was time to put my big girl pants on, I accepted the interview and suggested the closest possible date and earliest slot available to avoid any hesitation or procrastination. In the run up to the interview I resisted the urge to share my news for fear of jinxing it and went to the interview with no one around me knowing what I was about to do. Once I arrived at the building it started to sink in, I was greeted at reception and shown to the interview room in which I was instructed to wait outside. Inside the room I could see two friendly looking women, I took a deep breath and thought ""I can do this"" then to my surprise a third seemingly less friendly woman entered the room, it was then that I began to doubt. I entered the room and attempted to keep my nerves at bay, my way is when in doubt fake it til you make it. The interview was comfortable and once introduced to the women I could feel the warm nature from them all, the questions were all manageable and I felt like I had answered the best that I could. I  said my goodbyes and left the building, it was then I took the opportunity to let my parents know about the interview. They were over the moon ! I told them not to get too excited as I didn't want to chance it and let them down if it didn't go to plan. The next morning I awoke to two voicemails, one asking me to call the university and another offering me the job !",0,Truthful,0.5428377,True

They kept my depression at bay. After I lost my first dog I didn't want another dog because I couldn't bare feeling that loss. I didn't have a say in getting another dog. One day he was just there. I wasn't told before hand. Although I resent not being told before hand and not being considered about experiencing that loss again I couldn't be happier that my second dog came into my life. A few years passed and I lost my second dog to cancer. I has absolutely heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. This time I did want another dog because I couldn't stand the loneliness. My family said no. Another few years had passed since and I was now out on my own, living with my partner. I had tried to convince him to get a dog for a long while. He agreed, but finances made it a long process as dogs are quite expensive in my country. We tried adopting, but was not chosen multiple times because we do not have a backyard. 

Finally, an ad was posted. The price was right and it was not too far from where we lived. I was filled with a combination of happiness, nerves and anxiety. We reached out to the seller and anxiously waited his response. Hoping that a puppy would still be available to us. He came back to us and said there was still puppies available. In fact there was only one person ahead of us in line to choose a puppy. I was so happy, but still very nervous. Thinking that something would happen or would go wrong as I had waited for this for so long. 

The day came when we would go and reserve our puppy. My boyfriend and I took the drive. The navigation in the car took us down a wrong path and we almost got completely stuck on a rocky old country road made for tractors that went through a field. I was thinking that that was it, I know something would go wrong to make us lose the puppy. But we managed to get off the rocky road by me walking ahead of the car pointing out big rocks to try and avoid so it wouldn't scrape up the underneeth of the car. 

We made it to pick out our puppy. We had decided we wanted a boy dog as that was what I had had previously and knew how to take care of. Once there the one person a head of us to pick out a puppy was there so we were waiting in the garden until they were done. The seller had misunderstood us or confused us with someone elses preference, so he handed us two puppy girls to get acquainted with while the seller finished wrinting the contract with the one ahead of us. The puppy my boyfriend got handed fell asleep in his arms straight away. The puppy I got handed was a playful little one that was biting the strings on my hoodie. 

We later got to meet the rest of the puppies and also got to hold some of the boy puppies as that was what we initially thought we wanted. The seller asked if we wanted to se how some of the puppies interacted with the bigger dogs outside of their pen and we said yes. The bigger dogs was the mom, sister and aunt of the puppies. We decided to see how the two girl puppies we were first handed and how one of the boys acted around the big dogs. The boy puppy wandered off to explore some sticks. The girl puppy I first held that liked my hoodie went off to be with her mom and the puppy that fell asleep in my boyfriends arms came straight up to my feet to sniff around. It felt like she picked us. My boyfriend felt exactly the same and not many words were exchanged before we decided that she was the one. We just felt in that moment that it was right, where as before that it was extremly hard to choose. All puppies are lovely after all. 

It's been nine months now and I don't regret one moment that she is the one we picked. I love her more than anything and she is what brightens my day.",0,Truthful,0.57097876,True

The number of eyes looking back at me was nerve wrecking as I gave my answer to each question. The questions that were asked were not challenging at all as I did have previous working experience that was aligned with the questions that were asked, as well as the schooling experience I had received was compatible with what was asked of me.

I deduced from that interview that I would be appointed as I was able to offer the answers that were in my line of experience as it relates to the interview too.

When I walked back to my transport, I shared with my driver just how the interview went and I recalled all the career decisions that prepared me for that interview. I was so convinced that this job would be the pinnacle of my career and the highlight of my career.

I arrived at home from the interview and shared with my relatives the details of the interview. They asked about the questions that were asked and I how I felt about the interview.

Fast forward to January 2023, I finally got the opportunity to travel and meet my love. I had all the required paperwork in form of visa and purchased my ticket for what was excitedly one of my most memorable experiences.
Being from a third world country, I never had the opportunity to travel by plane ever. This was my first. 
On a negative, the excitement led me to almost miss my flight as I was held back by family who were as excited as I was. We had a long time for good byes and set off for the journey to the airport quite late, understandably so.
So I get to the airport and it was last call. I had no clue what that meant for a fact. I blindly joined a queue only to be told by the people I meant at the check-in desk that they were in fact waiting for me, and that if I was later than that for just five minutes I'd find them long gone.
 Anyway, I was allowed to check in and finally boarded my flight. I was in awe at this monster of a vehicle as I climbed up the steps on to the aircraft. I found everybody else had already taken their seats on the plane. Everything about the flight was just astounding, the take off mostly. I had never imagined how such a heavy vehicle travels at lightning speeds to engage the clouds above. 
time went by and we got to our layover airport. More astonishment ensued as I saw even a larger, better organised airport with lots of people swarming and crossing paths- all racing to get to their connecting flights I was told by some random stranger I asked. I quickly followed suite as I already had a near-miss experience and as the saying goes ""once beaten"" I did not want to take any chances. I was among the first people on the queue to board for the connecting flight.
We got to our destination safe and sound. Everything about the journey was indeed memorable from the meal service to the in-flight entertainment and everything in between on both legs of the journey.
On arrival at my destination I cleared the immigration procedures and the person who was giving me directions on how to traverse everything was on the other end, anxiously waiting for me as I could tell.

For about 6 or 8 months he never tried to reach out to me via message or interact with me on social media.

We all drove down to the destination from the airport, and we had such a drive getting to know one another. Moving along we all had a great time at the wedding there was some signs that he had liked me during our weekend stay. When we arrived back from the wedding, he would constantly make an effort to reach out but either sending a text or commenting on my stories. Eventually we were texting back and forth, until he decided to get me flowers for Valentines Day and dropped it off after work that day. We then told each other that we had liked one another and but eventually came to agreement that it wouldn't work out because we are following different religions. The women would have to change her religion in order for the relationship to work that's at least what had been shared with me at the time. We decided we would not pursue anything and remain friends. Kid you not we started chatting again the next day as if nothing had happened and eventually went on our first date and decided we were dating/seeing each other. We spent a lot of time together and went on a lot of fun dates, he got to meet my family but unfortunately didn't take me to meet his family. My family would constantly ask about the relationship because they knew that women that dated men following that religion wasn't always treated well, therefore they encouraged me that the relationship would not work out. Due to the pressure, I had decided that I would need to end the relationship somehow. Also, when he sent the friend request, I was intrigued but when I met him in the airport I felt as if though he looked younger and somehow as the weekend progressed, I started liking him. We had a mutual connection to girl that we both knew, and I always thought that they girl liked him, and he somehow liked her because she would constantly heart all his pictures on social media and he would constantly talk about her, like a lot.

The girl asked about his whereabouts and suggested that he should come visit sometime. He responded and said that he was with me, and the call ended. Because he constantly talking about the girl, I immediately thought that it was not a coincidence that she was calling all of a sudden. I asked him about the call and the nature of their relationship, he mentioned that they hardly speak and that they not in contact. I immediately thought that he was lying about it all because you wouldn't talk about someone unless you also like them and because my family also mentioned that our relationship wouldn't work because of different religions I decided I would end the relationship.

Despite my best intentions, last year I experienced a significant setback when I missed an important assignment deadline. This incident not only highlighted the adverse effects procrastination has on me but also served as a crucial learning experience that reshaped my approach to time management and responsibility. The assignment in question was an important part of my coursework, designed to assess my understanding and application of key medical concepts. Initially, I felt confident about completing it on time. However, as the deadline approached, I found myself reportedly postponing the work. Each day, I rationalized that there was still enough time left, and the other tasks seemed to take priority. This pattern of procrastination continued until the night before the deadline, when I realised the panic in me starting to rise and that the task was far more extensive that I thought. Several factors contributed to my procrastination. Firstly, a lack of clear of clear prioritization played a big role. In the whirlwind of clinical rotations, lectures and other assignments, it's easy to lose track of which tasks were most urgent. Secondly, an underestimation of the time required to complete the assignment led to false sense of security. I misjudged the complexity of the project and the amount of research and effort it would entail. lastly, personal distractions and a tendency to overcommit to other activities further diverted my focus. The immediate consequence of missing the deadline was a significant deduction in my grade for the course. Beyond the academic penalty, the experience was a wake up call regarding the importance of effective time management and discipline. Missing the deadline triggered a period of self-reflection and prompted me to seek strategies to avoid repeating the same mistake twice. In response, I implemented several changes. I began using a detailed planner to map out my tasks and deadlines breaking down larger assignments into smaller parts with specific goals. This helped me stay on track and avoid last minute rushing. Additionally I adopted techniques to help me minimise distractions such as designated study times and environments and set clear boundaries. In the end missing that assignment was a pivotal point in my academic journey. It showed me the importance and need to be proactive in planning and time management. The lesson learnt will improve my academic journey for the better and always.",0,Truthful,0.77094924,True

The truth is that because the task seemed pretty simple and because I knew it wasn't my fault for the short deadline, I was also working on something else at the time at work, so I wanted to finish my previous task before getting on that one, even though I knew it was pretty urgent. I also knew I'd be getting extra help from someone else, so I imagined that we could finish it all pretty quickly together.

Unfortunately, as the other person was inexperienced, they were very slow, and as mentioned in the story, I also had to later correct their mistakes. I showed them the basics of powerpoint and how to use it, but they made certain mistakes that I didn't foresee.

Therefore, I believe it was only partly my fault that we missed the initial deadline, aside from that, I was working on it full time and trying to work fast as well, to get it done as quickly as possible.

The reason it was memorable was because I remember trying to work on it as quickly as possible for several days, the frustration I felt with the inexperienced colleague, but especially the frustration and anger I felt with the professor, who later put the blame on me about missing details on the final deliverable even though I believe it was his fault for forgetting about it and giving us such a short timeline to complete it. He can also be quite crude and rude with his students or employees.

This is the truthful version with the one fabrication/lie taken out:
I was given a specific task at work by a consultant of our company who is also a university professor. It was a pretty menial task, transfer the information from some old slides to a Word document, which would be used as an e-book guide for employees, and then create some new, clean, slideshows with the updated info. This was a job done in favor of another company. A certain percentage of the task had already been done by someone else previously, around the holidays, specifically Christmas time, but the professor had forgotten about it, and therefore, when the task was given to me, he assumed 2-3 days would be enough to complete it as the deadline to submit it to the other organization was during those days.
Unfortunately, his calculation was off, even though the task was pretty simple, recreating some of the visuals and making sure everything looked right and clean was more time consuming than he initially thought. I even had a second person come on board to help out, and we still ended up needing 2-3 extra days to complete it all as the e-book was pretty big. Aside from that, as the other person was completely inexperienced using the office suite and it was the first time they were using it, I had to often correct their mistakes, which meant extra work for myself in the end. I was even blamed by the professor for missing some details, and he said I should have been more attentive as this would be the final deliverable, even though he initially gave us such a short time frame to complete it all but still expected perfection, he also wasn't aware of the extra mistakes I had to correct thanks to the other person.",0,Truthful,0.9915225,True

We were in a long-distance relationship. We started off well, experiencing a honeymoon phase as with new couples do, even though it was online.

Anyways, to start with the incident, my ex-partner had taken a vacation during this time.

I was quite pissed off at this point (Sorry for my language, maybe I am ranting about the situation now) and I tried calling him. When he finally messaged me back, I knew immediately from the tone of his texts and the following call after that he was attempting to break up with me. He told me that he wants to find someone else near him, and he wants to start focusing on his future. I went a bit mad. I didn't call him names, nor did I insult him.

I just wanted to cry and hurl, but I couldn't even do that because I felt nothing and everything all at once.

After that, I blocked him on all social media platforms and told him never to chat me again. Now, I am thriving as a bachelor in a new country, studying at one of my dream universities. I still think about him and our situation from time to time, but I am facing this new era without him, head on.

I also have also retrofitted fleet-management tools in my trucks to ensure that the drivers are following the rules of the road. Near my destination, there was a speed trap put in a random location where there was no indication of a speed limit prior to arriving and it caught out my driver who was doing 80 kph. The driver informed me that he was stopped for speeding and was issued a fine for travelling 80kph in a 60kph zone but this was disputed because there were no road signs prior to the spot where the traffic official was location.",1,Truthful,0.9906103,False

None of us were cycling side by side. As we were cycling steadily, a car lost control and crashed into our group. The next thing I remembered was that I was staring at the sky and feeling numb below.

On a Friday, 6th Of September 2022, just after I had suppet with my family we had a break in. Four armed men jumped the fence abd and broke the door and held everyone at gun point. They wanted cash and jewellery. I kept telling them we have nothing and they got irritated shot me on the foot, grabbed the TV and ran. My family called an ambulance in attempt to rush me to hospital and a trip that could have taken them 10 mins, they only arrived after 45 mins and that point I had bled to almost point of death. When they arrived they took forever to examine instead of rushing me to hospital. When we arrived the doctor examined me and said I need to be tushed to theater to save my arm but they didn't rush.. Instead I spent an hour there trying to get my details. After an hour they tell me there aren't enough beds at the theater and that my cover will only pay 10 percent of the costs, mind you i am in pain and agony. 

So I'm screaming please help me i can't breathe and they don't pay attention to me. Finally they took me to theater and did a surgery to remove the bullet, and all of this is being done while i am slightly sedated which means I could feel some of the pain. After  the surgery I barely received care, I had to shout oe crawl to the passage to ask for assistance from a nurse. Even when they were they they didn't even look at me and only gave me cheap meds that didn't numb any pain.

2 days after, I was sick of it and called my health insurance asking to be transferred to a better hospital for better care because even my mental health was deteriorating. The health insurance refused plain to move me and say they have already started processing payments for this hospital and cannot help. I continued to inform them of the negligence in this hospital and how this was impacting me mentally and the lady on the phone whose name i can't remember said they can't help and dropped the phone on me.

For the next week I had to suffer in pain without assistance. I was then told that I need to go for another surgery because they saw something during the scan but my insurance will not be covering the bill. I was told that if I don't do the surgery ASAP i could end up losing mobility. So my family had to struggle to put together this money and then my insurance was not picking up their phone.

Eventually I had the surgery again and all was well but now that I have been discharged I want the insurance to refund me for the trauma that they caused me and my family!

The person checking my pass told me that I had to leave the train or I would get fined. The problem is: I needed this train to get to my exam on time, otherwise I would miss it. The expression of stress and worry must have displayed on my face, because the guy looked at me really concerned and asked me if I was feeling okay. Now, I'm not a person to lie usually, but the idea just crossed my mind and it seemed more convincing than just a student missing his exam. 
So, I told him that my sister just had an accident, that the police called me and that I just ran to the station and got on the first train I saw with the right destination. I didn't even think about the ticket.
It's important to note that I was especially stressed and anxious about this exam, and had spent all night studying, so it wasn't hard for me to make my eyes all watery.
Long story short, the guy was so worried about me that you told to forget about the ticket and just try to relax that everything was gonna be alright. I still think about that to this day because he was really nice to me and it made me feel especially guilty for lying.",1,Truthful,0.73407334,False

The doctor diagnosed me and recommended circumcision for my problem. We made a plan and booked an appointment for hospitalization and surgery on a hospital. 

The day of the surgery I travelled to the hospital ready to have the surgery. They collected my personal details and told me to wait because my room was not ready for me yet. I had to wait 4 hours in the hospital's waiting room for a planned appointment. Everything was supposed to be planned and ready for me. After they assigned a bed to me I decided that it is okay and I will just forget it as long as I am done with this surgery.

After the surgery I woke up when the anesthesia wore off. As I woke up, I immediately felt a sharp pain on my genitals. I asked the nurse if that was normal and they confirmed that it is okay to hurt. I was in so much pain I was getting dizzy, I was on the verge of passing out. The nurse insisted it was okay and in the end let me go. I had to travel alone while dizzy and in indescribable pain in my most intimate body area.

As days passed and I was taking care of my surgical scars and area, I started to realize that there was an optical problem with my genitals. It looked like something went wrong with the surgery. I asked my doctor to examine me again. During the examination, he was hesitant in the way he was talking to me as if he was trying to hide a mistake that was made during my surgery.

I tried to react quiclky and brake, but the road was extremely slippery due to heavy rain that had started moments before, whice caused my car to slide and collide with the back of the lady's car who had braked hard.

Additionally, the impact caused a leak in my car's radiator, making it inoperable.

The booking time for the appointment was at 8AM and I remember I was completely nervous, because I only read bad things about this treatment. Normally, the treatment would require me to go accompanied of someone who could pick me up and take care of me at home, but because I didn't have no one, I was warned that most probably I was going to be forced to stay in the hospital ward overnight. While waiting for the appointment, I was sure that I would be allowed to go home once the nurses saw I was completely fine. But after I woke up from the treatment, I saw how the nurses chatted about where to send me, which room it was my room, and so on. Luckily, I was sent to the same hospital's ward, so a nurse came to pick me up and carried my bed gurney to my room. I remember seeing the nurse and thinking she was quite stylish, she had black hair and some bangs, and either some nice necklace or bracelets, I can't remember exactly. Because the hospital is newly constructed, the room looked quite good and neat. It had sliding doors and a lot of buttons and panels to do hospital stuff I didn't know how or why are used for. I had the room for myself and it was very comfortable. Even though everything seemed fine, I was still convinced I could go home if I talked with the nurses and told them I was feeling great. Because of the required fasting for the treatment, I had skipped breakfast, so the nurses brought to me the breakfast stray. I was so surprised to see that the breakfast was actually fancy, nothing like what one is told when hearing about hospital foods. The breakfast was squeezed orange juice, yogurt with granola, a toast with butter and some black tea. I found this funny because the room already looked like a hotel room, and then I had some fancy breakfast too. When they came to pick up the tray I asked the nurse to review if I could go home, but the nurse kind of dismissed me and said I will go home when a doctor sees me. During the day they came to measure my temperature and check on how I was doing. I was too ashamed to ask again if I could go, and also I didn't want to bother the nurses or go out of my room. So I waited for the lunch service.

She could only nod, didn't say or confirmed that I could go, but she went out of the room and later arrived with the doctor. He asked me what my temperatures had been, how I felt, if I'm feeling nauseous or if I had any side effects from anesthesia, and then finally, agreed that I could go home only if I took a taxi.

The job was a work-from-home opportunity that aligned with my goal of becoming a lawyer one day and with what I studied in university. After going through a rigorous application process that had me completing English tests, writing essays, and recording voice notes in the middle of the night, I received a rejection email from the firm informing me that I did not even qualify for an interview. I was shattered. The loss of that opportunity felt like I had lost a part of me (I had a lot riding on the opportunity, particularly with the idea of growing my business).

A little over two months ago, the company I had applied to for my dream job contacted me with an offer to apply for another work-from-home opportunity. The offer to apply did not guarantee that I would get the job, but because I had qualifications that aligned, it was likely that if things went well, I would get it. This was mindblowing to me. The first opportunity would have had me working as an assistant, while this new opportunity would have had me conducting investigations and compiling reports, abiding by criminal law and criminal investigation requirements. I didn't even know that such a job existed online (I didn't know people could investigate exclusively online). With this invitation, I was also invited to an application training to help ensure that my new application met the standards that my previous one didn't. 
Several days after applying, I was invited for an interview (which I aced, thanks to the training I think). I was then invited for a week-long formal training session, and then matched with a firm that needed me. I've been working for this firm for just under a month now. 

I initially thought that the assistant job was my dream job (because I hadn't known that my current job exists), but I have found my actual dream job. It turned out that even though I had initially thought that the world was completely against me (lost my dad and several uncles less than 24 months ago), the universe actually had a better offer brewing.

It lasted for about six months and although I had been depressed in my life before, this time around it was worse. I started going to therapy in order to deal with it. The therapy helped me because my therapist seemed to care a lot about me and just having someone to care about me was enough for me I guess. I suffered a lot of things in my past that my therapist pointed that it must be because of that. My father was never in my life and my mom told me that he rejected me. So i grew up with my step dad, and when my step dad and mom separated, we moved back to the village where my mom and my real dad are from. That is where I met my dad a=but my mom would punish me every time I went to see him. In the village we were staying with my grandma, my cousins, and my uncle. My uncle was very abusive and he raped me twice in that year when I moved to the village with my mom. I never told anyone especially my mom because she was always angry at me for seeing my dad. So growing up I was sad and depressed. So my therapist told me that it was because of this and we tried to resolve this issue. At first the therapy was working and great, but when we started going into the deep stuff about my past, I started getting worse. Although my therapist told me that this was a normal thing to happen, I just couldn't deal with it. I started having thoughts of killing myself because i did not see the point of living. I would even plan out how I would die, sometimes while walking by the road i would get thoughts to throw myself in front of a moving car. One night I was very very depressed and I was at my worse and I made up my mind that I am just going to die. I thought I will never get better and even if I do, I am just going to get hurt again because that is how life is so I should just end the pain now. During those days, I had a sex partner that I would have sex so i decided to go sleep with him one last time because I thought maybe it will make me feel better. So I went and we started by four play and all those stuff, but during that, I was getting worse and I decided to stop but he got angry and told me that I have no right to deny him sex since I came on my own.

We got a meeting scheduled on the 1st of September with all the moderators, the CEO, our community manager Kiki, and Tess another upper management member. 

Anthony was the only one who spoke during the entire meeting and told us what we already expected. The project was not making enough money and because of that most of the team was going to be released.

Anthony was pretty straight forward, explaining that the 2 other founders that were responsible for funding didn´t want to be involved in the project anymore so changes had to be made. He also told us that this was not the end, that the project would continue as some team members would be taking over the project. They still had some money but now they had to be super cautious on how to use it. 

Afterward, the mods, our ex-community manager Poco and Kiki had their own little meeting, I told them I could not go, I was not in the right mind space for it after such devastating news. They all understood. 

When I left the meeting I just went in survival mode. I loved this job and I did not want to lose it. I knew the team still had some money available and they would need someone to take care of at least some of the things, they could not do everything themselves. 

I had a lot of knowledge about the project, had been there since the beginning, and claimed my way up from a moderator to interim community manager at one point. I knew I was one of the more versatile team members that knew how to handle things in a o lot of different departments.

So I quickly messaged Anthony and I proposed to act as a Moderator, Head Moderator, and Community Manager, doing all the community activities, customer support, and taking care of social media while reducing my salary from 3000 a month to 2000 a month. I live in Portugal so 2000 us dollars a month is a fortune basically. 

I told them that in this new era, they needed someone who could do a lot of things, did not complain, and didn´t take a high salary. I was loyal from the start, worked very hard, and was very adaptable. He knew this so he said he would discuss it with the team and gave me the answer later. 

Then I realized. The discord was very slow now, the team would realize they didn´t need me. I was desperate so I hired a bunch of people to create chaos in the Discord, and was able to convince some community members who by this point were very close to me to create some issues so I could remain on the team. 

By my surprise this worked wonderfully. At the same time there was a problem on the website with our token generation which was just the perfect sign to let me stay on the team!

Anthony messaged me saying that they indeed needed help so they offered me a 6 month contract! 

I was so happy I could stay but I felt sad for the others that had to go.

I got overwhelmed by all the options (time of travel. types of discounts, city sector) and didn't know which to choose, so I opted for an expensive ticket to be on the safe side. Once I got on the bus I was traveling like planned, but when a control came, it turned out I was supposed to use my app to scan my ticket in a machine that's on the bus to make it valid. Nowhere was it mentioned in the app, resulting me in driving without a valid ticket.",1,Truthful,0.6746792,False

She comes from a very traditional Indian family, while my background is much more liberal in nature. I'd known for a long time she was going back to India for three months in the spring, only, she never told me the actual true reason why. Her parents had set her up with an arranged marriage. 
I don't have the means to intervene here. I'm unemployed, and have been for a long time. I'm the type of person to never ask anything for myself but I will admit that for a person like her, I'll do anything. I'll get on my knees and beg, if that's what it takes. I know that in order to do anything, anything at all, I need to actually physically GET THERE. Her phone is not equipped with an international number and her access to wifi is so sporadic. We've only had the chance to communicate for very brief periods of time since she landed in India. 
I barely know what's going on over there anymore. She's not able to tell me. 
Even if it amounts to nothing, I have to TRY. 
I can't believe this is my life in the year 2024 I thought this stuff was long dead. It feels like I'm living a movie script. Though I expect this to have a much more reality-fitting gut punch of an ending.

We checked the ticket prices, and didn't like what we saw. We decided we would likely be able to get away with hopping on the high speed line without a ticket, given the likely chaos on the railway lines.

Unfortunately (but not surpisingly), the bus public transport company is notorious for its poor service (frequent delays, canceled rides, crumbling vehicles, ecc.) and is particularly hated by travelers, especially since they have raised fares a lot in few years (from 6€ to 8.10€ for the Florence-Lucca route, for example). Among these inefficiencies, there is in particular the lack of ticket offices (only one in Florence!!) where to buy physical bus tickets. That's why, recently, the local transportation company introduced the possibility of using eletronic tickets, which can be purchased on a 3rd-party App.
But, as expected, the app developed also turns out to be terrible. Bug and glitches make it painful to buy tickets and stamping is often buggy. The app crashes, loses connection often , and has to be restarted every time. Nevertheless, that day I opened my App and, patiently, I selected the ticket (bought in advance to avoid problems) and pressed the ""Validate"" button. Once done, I took my seat and ""enjoyed"" the ride.
When arrived at my destination, upon getting off the bus I checked my phone, and at that moment I realize that the app was still processing the ticket validation request (the spininng icon was still moving).
Hoping it was just a display bug, I restarted the app to find that the ticket had not been validated. 
Honestly, I didn't mind at the time: considering the bad service and the poor use of public funds (and therefore also my money), I walked away, not sorry at all.

It's a great opportunity for me to provide or sell items that people need.
After a long research about the market, I decided to take advantage of It. I bought an online course that was based on marketing since I didn't have any knowledge regarding marketing the items that I wanted to sell online. 

after learning marketing I implemented everything that I learned from my mentor and It wasn't as effective as I thought. It wasn't effective at all because I didn't make any sales. The platform where I had put my business required monthly payments which I couldn't afford. This means I had a limited time before they removed It. 

As much as I didn't make any sales, it wasn't the worst part about the whole thing. What was the worst of all was the fact that I didn't have any views on my platform, views I mean people who had to visit my business as in customers who were looking for the items I sell. As I said before about my items being on demand.

It turns out the whole thing was not going according to plan and also extremely confusing. Time was running out for paying my monthly subscription on the platform I had put my business on and I had no capital since I wasn't making any sales from the business.

During the audit there were client delays where we requested information and the information was not given to us on time in order to complete the execution of the audit and we did report these to the manager as they were likely to cause us to miss the deadline. there were times where we were given wrong information that resulted to more delays. 
The budgeted hours on the job were also not enough and when we requested for an overtime to be approved this request was rejected. all these factors combined resulted to us missing the deadline by a week.
As the delays were also communicated with the manager and the team did their best to meet the deadline it was not possible without working overtime and with client delays involved.
When asked to explain why we missed the deadline i did explain all these facts to the manager and the partner. I don't think it would be fair to blame us for missing the deadline and our performance ratings should not be affected by this.

Then I had to stay in the hospital because I was leaking amniotic fluid and blood. They couldn't let me go home. Either I would go into labor on my own in a few hours or I would be induced with intravenous artificial oxytocin. It was horrible. Since I wouldn't go into labor, they stared on synthetic intravenous oxytocin and it was very painful.

Since the girl was very big, she didn't come out easily. I was stuck and the midwives wouldn't letme get up. I was forced to lie down and it was very painful and traumatic. They climbed on top of my belly and squeezed with their hands, fists and elbows. They used medieval, obsolete practices, banned by the Wolrd Heath Organization for many years. I was injured.

They injured my abdomen, they gave me severe abdominal diastasi above my navel, right where they squeezed with their elbows. And I also had an umbilical hernia. In addition, they used forceps to get the girl out and they did a very large episiotomy, which has generated many complications for me.

My daughter was born with an open wound on her head, bleeding, with a totally abnormal shape. His forehead and nose were completely purple and she had a bleed eye that lasted two months.

We park and I ask my kid to remain calm and stay on his booster seat. I will go and see if Chuck is OK, then we'll get to school. 

as I approach him, I can see we are not going to school. Chuck's leg is twisted, he tells me he fell down the tree he was pruning. I offer to get him to the nearest clinic, I help him up and carefully seat him on the passenger's side. We rush to the clinic.

My kid is usually opinionated about things, and he has strong opinions about the things that alter his day to day. He did not say a word, other than 'You are going to be OK Chuck, They're going to fix you at the Hospital' I'm so proud of him.

We get to the clinic and an orderly seats him on a wheelchair, Chuck thanks me and disappears behind the glass doors.

So after recovering from an injury, I decided its time to take a bike trip, go across the Tardi Forest, and visit, the Parkforest, and some notable very old tree, marked on the Dendrology Webpage. The trip, first went well. Although de elevations seemed much tougher than I remembered. I enjoyed rolling down on the windy forest road, and even I've found some delicious mushrooms. At the end of the forest road, I take a short rest at a clearance where there was the statue of the Spirit of the Forest, with former Foresters' name on it. This part is one of my favourite part of the Tardi forest, as it is the oldest, with mighty Oaks which cover a scenic geography. After I finished my rest, I continued my way to a village. The road was slightly downhill from there so I just let myself roll and enjoy the scenery. The village was different though. It was much longer than it appeared on the map, and by the time I arrived to the Parkforest, I felt pretty tired. At the very end of the village, was the parkforest. I took off from my bike, and checked the sign, when suddenly two little kitten appeared around my leg. They seemed well fed, and healthy. So I was thinking they might be came from a house nearby. I pet them, then I hit the trail which marked with a Szekler Gate. For my surprise the cats followed me. The parkforest, despite small, was really worth the visit. The trail followed the canyon of a small creek, creating weird but beautiful geoshapes, meanwhile from the crowns of the trees, the sun light leaked, sometimes breakthrough giving an otherworldy illumination. And at the end of the track, there was an open church with benches and an altar, a Holy Mary statue, and the Holy Well itself. A stair led to the spring which was built around with stones. The cats were still around me, and one even laid down my lap after I wondered enough in the place and took a rest with snacks. Meanwhile I measured my physical status, my supplies in regard of planning the way back, my hunch grew stronger that the cats might be straight and it would might be better if I took them home. For me it was quite the struggle. First, I had to make a makeshift carrier to my carrier rack, where they feel good enough, and consider, I have to push my bike all way back home as I can't ride speedy with two cats, Eventually, I checked the map, and took a short cut trail, although it was in a terrible condition. And I managed to call a car as soon as I arrived to the other side of the forest into a village.

I asked him about the call why the girl was calling him and the nature of their relationship, he kept denying that they were in contact, and I immediately didn't believe anything he said because no one is going to keep mentioning someone if you too are not intrigued by them or interested in them. I had planned a group trip with friends to a coastal area for a week, while I was on my trip I had planned due to the situation of my boyfriend not being honest with me that I would break up with him and while on my trip I did exactly that. he tried to reach out to me for about a month and I didn't feel the need to contact or engage in conversation because this girl would too heart all his posts on social media. I gave him an opportunity to be honest and he chose not to be honest, so there was nothing else to further discuss.",1,Truthful,0.9264711,False

I took the same bus as always and I buy tickets almost all the time, to have a peace of mind. This time I simply forgot, because I was watching an interesting video on YouTube. I did not see the controllers at all. I tried to buy an online ticket, but he said to me to not bother, because the time would be off. It was then I noticed it was actually a three controllers - one went from the back of the bus, one from font and one from middle. The one from middle pinned me down on my spot, even tough I was sitting near the door and could eventually run off, as there were many chances, I simply did not, I wanted to apologize and resolve it with them. They wanted my ID and I immediately handed it to them, but I have mentioned that I buy tickets every time and I have sipmly forgotten this time. It was three relatively young and intelligent gentlemen. They wanted to let me off without a fine, but they could not because the incident was on the camera. But they mentioned, that if I buy ticket card for 150€ at the spot, I will not get the fine. I was really happy and accepted the terms as I did not know about the card and the option.

I felt that he was pulling away, to which I said 'Nice, more time for myself'. I trusted him and believed in our relationship, I knew it was just a phase and that we would find our ways back to each other eventually. I'd be lying if I said I didn't worry at all though. Sometimes I'd have moments where I'd get very tense and anxious about the future of our relationship. I was worried he had got sick of me, that something was wrong. Then he invited me to dinner one night. He wanted to take me to the restaurant where we had our very first date. I though 'Okay, no one would break up where we first met, right? This has to be a new beginning.'  Our anniversary was coming up in a month. I couldn't help but feel quite a bit of tension between us that day though. We ended up going to a different place because I had to work at a different site than usual, and they informed right before my shift. After dinner, as we were sitting in the middle of the restaurant, he held my hand, looked deep into my eyes, and said he needed a break from the relationship. His reasons didn't make any sense, they seemed make-shift excuses. He was unnecessarily harsh and instantly got deffensive when I tried reasoning with him. I told him not to be a coward and just break up with me for good. That I didn't wanna be with someone who'd want a break from me, especially when we've been giving each other more space already. I was hurt and terrified of losing him deep inside, but stood up for myself, because I knew my worth and that I deserve someone who truly appreciates me. I told him it was just his dismissive avoidant attachment style kicking in, and there's nothing I can do, so he should sleep on it and if he really wants to lose me, then fine. I stood up from the table, grabbed my things, said good-bye and stormed out of the restaurant. He ran after me asking me to wait, but I just said 'Sleep on it, we'll talk tomorrow!' and kept going. The next day he came to me with a potted plant as a gift, the kind I had been eyeing for a while. He apologized and said he was acting on an impulse, and that he has reconsidered and didn't wanna lose me. We both knew it was going to be hard, but decided to give it a shot. He started therapy the week after, and we still have arguments, but are working through our issues.",1,Truthful,0.8674095,False

However, last year, I faced an unexpected challenge that resulted in me missing a crucial assignment deadline. Despite my best efforts and careful planning, circumstances beyond my control prevented me from completing the assignment on time. the experience highlighted the unpredictable nature of life and the importance of adaptability in the face of unforeseen events. However, as the deadline approached, a series of unexpected events disturbed my meticulously planned schedule. Firstly, a sudden family emergency demanded my immediate attention and presence, significantly reducing the time I could dedicate to my studies. This emergency was unavoidable and took precedence over my academic responsibilities, as family well-being is paramount. Simultaneously, a technical issue with my laptop added to the chaos. Just days before the submission date, my laptop malfunctioned, resulting in the loss of critical data and research materials. Despite my best attempts to recover the lost work and the hours spent trying to fix the issue, the technical failure proved insurmountable within the limited time available. The setback was compounded by the fact that access to university resources and support was limited due to ongoing pandemic-related restrictions. Additionally, an unexpected health issue further complicated the situation. I fell ill with a severe flu, which rendered me physically incapable of focusing on my studies for several days. This illness was an unforeseen obstacle that drastically reduced my productivity and ability to complete the assignment as planned. Despite these challenges, I communicated promptly with my professors, explaining the situation and seeking possible extensions or accommodations. Their understanding and support underscored the importance of open communication and the recognition that sometimes, even the best laid out plans can be derailed by circumstances beyond our control.",1,Truthful,0.86550593,False

Earlier that day she had told me that she was going to attend church together with her younger sister, mother and grandmother. i told her that she would call me after church if she is not busy. Then after church she didn't call me so i thought that she was busy or mybe even sleeping as she once told me that he church was very far. 

I have a relative that lives in the same village as her and her name is Asanda she is my aunt 35 years old. later the day i received a call from her telling me that there is something important she wants to tell me. she said that she saw my girlfriend cheating on me with another boy on her way back to school. She said they first kissed each other in the near by river and they went to the boys home where they spend hours inside. She proceeded by sending me pictures of them together there was no picture of the them kissing or holding hands like she said. nor the picture where they entered the boy's house.

At that point i was a bit worried but i didn't fully trust my aunt as i know she likes to randomly lie sometimes. After that i the called my girlfriend and asked her where was she after church she told me that she just fell asleep after she got home and forgot to tell me. showed her pictures sent to me by my aunt and asked who was that boy she was with.

It was a pretty menial task, transfer the information from some old slides to a Word document, which would be used as an e-book guide for employees, and then create some new, clean, slideshows with the updated info. This was a job done in favor of another company. A certain percentage of the task had already been done by someone else previously, around the holidays, specifically Christmas time, but the professor had forgotten about it, and therefore, when the task was given to me, he assumed 2-3 days would be enough to complete it as the deadline to submit it to the other organization was during those days.
Unfortunately, his calculation was off, even though the task was pretty simple and I got on it immediately, recreating some of the visuals and making sure everything looked right and clean was more time consuming than he initially thought. I even had a second person come on board to help out, and we still ended up needing 2-3 extra days to complete it all as the e-book was pretty big. Aside from that, as the other person was completely inexperienced using the office suite and it was the first time they were using it, I had to often correct their mistakes, which meant extra work for myself in the end. I was even blamed by the professor for missing some details, and he said I should have been more attentive as this would be the final deliverable, even though he initially gave us such a short time frame to complete it all but still expected perfection, he also wasn't aware of the extra mistakes I had to correct thanks to the other person.",1,Truthful,0.9096072,False

It happened 1 month ago because he was feeling tired, short of breath and in pain from having 5 broken ribs. One day, while coughing, he became so short of breath that we had to call an emergency ambulance to take him to the hospital and admit him. They did breathing tests, put him on oxygen masks and did rehabilitation so that he could breathe better and not feel so much fatigue. He underwent surgery to remove fluid from the pleura and all symptoms subsided. Now he is at home recovering from the after-effects, but his mood is improving and his physical condition is improving as well. In fact, he is doing sports little by little as a hobby and, by the way, gaining lung capacity to improve his quality of life after the traumatic shock of having been hospitalized for about 1 month.
