I was still a college student and this would be my first job if I did well. I was nervous and I kept thinking about the job to the point where I forgot you cannot extend your student transit card inside a bus. I realized the problem while I was waiting at the bus stop, just a few minutes before it arrived. So I did what I thought would be fun and kind of risky. I decided to enter the bus through the back door, which is the door passengers usually leave the bus from. The front door is used to get on the bus, the back door was used only when you want to get out. The ticket control person was not on the bus that ride, so I just got a free ride. I got to the company HQ and I got the job! The next day, since I would use that bus very often from that day forward, I decided to extend my student city transit card.;city nearby hometown go application process job industry college student job nervous keep think job point forget extend student transit card inside bus realize problem wait bus stop minute arrive think fun kind risky decide enter bus door door passenger usually leave bus door bus door want ticket control person bus ride get free ride get company hq get job day use bus day forward decide extend student city transit card;4;0.190721649484536;5.0;4.5;2.0
65391353897d68dd53a067da;Ending a long romantic relationship;Truthful;0;It was a 5 year relationship and we were very attached to each other. Until she cheated on me and lied about it. I found out because I went through her phone, which is a very immoral thing to do and I felt like throwing up when I did it. But she kept lying to me. And then we broke up, but I still couldn't break the attachment, because we lived together and did everything together. So when she moved out, I completely lost it. I felt like a car could hit me anytime when walking down the street because I was so in my head and my thoughts. It was like I was a ghost or something. Every thought I had was about it. I was extremely angry and sad and felt betrayed and I still missed her and wanted to talk to her.

At night he would switch his phone off. That made me very concerned and i spoke to him about it but he made it seem like i was over reacting. The week went by until he had to go to work on the thursday. I decided to search around his apartment what was it that he was hiding.

For the duration of the planning we worked from a different country to the one that had been identified as the host country for the event.

The event made me relook my position in the company and whether or not my efforts, input and role where respected; which lead to a change in roles and a favourable conclusion (to me).

We got to the country and prepared for the event, with all our guests arriving, some after a lengthy back and forth with customs. Never the less, the 3 day event went well, granted there were glitches, but overall a good experience. On the day that ""the last minute event"" was to take place, my superior asked me to handle the audio and visual components for the final event or said ""last minute event"", which happens to rely heavily on the audio and visuals I was asked to put together...IN THE LAST MINUTE! Needless to say, I felt disrespected as, to my surprise, there were meetings about the final leg of the event or ""the last hurrah"" but I was not invited to any of the meetings, but at the last hour, I was asked to handle the event at the last minute. I handled and fulfilled the requests, but I was not impressed.

I then excused myself and did not attend the event as by the time guests started arriving at the venue, I was still at the venue trying to sort out the last minute logistics of the event.

6596830f2825d3d95e7d5d6e;Cheating on an exam;Truthful;0;I had an online exam in Remote Sensing. The teacher uses a programme to make it impossible to copy. The application is installed and blocks access to external programmes, browsers and chats. We have to have the webcam switched on throughout the exam to ensure that the student is taking the exam himself. It also makes it possible to see whether the student is looking at the computer or elsewhere and issues a warning when it detects a risk of cheating. The programme also records the sound so that you can see if there is any external help. This is a very complicated subject with a lot of material and the exam is only 20 minutes long. In addition, the exam has 40 multiple-choice questions. Analysing the time available, you can only spend 30 seconds on each question, which is very little time to read and think calmly. This creates a lot of stress, even if the questions are easy. Every year many students repeat the exam. This year, the teacher gave a set of questions that could appear in the final exam. Over the course of a week, I did these questions over and over again until I tried to memorize the answers but it was near impossible because there where so many different questions,  When I started the exam, the anti-fraud app crashed meaning you could you get outside help and consult books or summaries. What's more, there's a lot of pressure when using the anti-fraud programme because it feels like someone is always watching your behavior and keeping an eye on you. When I took the exam, it was a great relief when I realized that I could use the CHATGPT app to search for the aswers. All I had to do was fake that i was reading the questions calmly and search the aswers. The exam went very well and although the questions weren't all the same, I was able to pass with confidence. My classmates who didn't didn't cheat got lower marks and some failed the exam. I felt very relieved to get a sufficient mark.;online exam remote sensing teacher use programme impossible copy application instal block access external programme browser chat webcam switch exam ensure student take exam make possible student look computer issue warning detect risk cheating programme record sound external help complicated subject lot material exam 20 minute long addition exam 40 multiple choice question analyse time available spend 30 second question little time read think calmly create lot stress question easy year student repeat exam year teacher give set question appear final exam course week question try memorize answer near impossible different question start exam anti fraud app crash mean outside help consult book summary lot pressure anti fraud programme feel like watch behavior keep eye take exam great relief realize use chatgpt app search aswer fake read question calmly search aswer exam go question able pass confidence classmate cheat get low mark fail exam feel relieved sufficient mark;5;0.0690690690690691;4.0;3.0;3.0

663f6c3c00d480a9ce332aec;Ending a long romantic relationship;Truthful;0;"My ex-partner and I had been in a relationship for 2 years. We met online and formed a long distance relationship. 

He went offline 2 weeks before we broke up. During this time, I was filled with anxiety since this period was the time when I was doing many interviews for my dream universities. I tried messaging him, but he wasn't responding. He did say that he was with his family and dealing with his therapist for his apparent depression (in which case, I reiterate that I did not slight him for this).

In the actual break-up scene, he chatted me and told me about his worries. As I said, I knew from his tone and when he called me that he didn't want to do it anymore. The lie comes with me being pissed and mad at him. At this point, i truly was tired from all the interviews and I accepted the inevitable. It was quite robotic how I handled the breakup. I did feel as though an elephant sat on my chest, but I handled it relatively ""gracefully"" even my ex-partner was impressed. Of course, I hate him now because of that response, but at the time, I was just completely emotionless and silent. It was really hard for me but at the same time, I just wasn't processing it. 

Perhaps a thing that also lead to me not processing it was because this time period was also the time where I was preparing for my graduation.

They mentioned something about a company that works on data entry, and that I was qualified for what they offered and that many people were signed up with them besides me.
Having been unemployed for a long time, I was eager to try to get that job. I sent my cv to many other companies while waiting for it, but never really got accepted anywhere. At some point a few months back, I got an interview with that company. I was excited and thought I would do well, but well, here we are.
Before the interview, they asked me to do a test, answering some questions about performance in the field and stuff like that. Test was accepted, and we moved on to an actual interview. I had to answer some questions, demonstrate that I can speak english well during the interview and so on. The interviewer seemed satisfied, but I eventually got an email telling me that they went for someone else, more qualified. I'm still quite bothered by that.";start year sign association help autistic people find job mention company work datum entry qualified offer people sign having unemployed long time eager try job send cv company wait get accept point month get interview company excited think interview ask test answer question performance field stuff like test accept move actual interview answer question demonstrate speak english interview interviewer satisfied eventually get email tell go qualified bother;6;0.272151898734177;4.0;2.83333333333333;3.3333333333333335

When I reached a point where I had to turn left, I was very distracted and almost continued straight. When I realized I almost missed the turn, I turned left without thinking or checking the road. As a result, a man on a motorcycle that was at the opposite lane crashed on my car.

What made the interview most memorable was when the CEO asked me of any major setbacks I had on any projects.

I left the hostel by myself at around 9 a.m. After all, the train ride would take around an hour to get there, and I wanted to make the most out of my time in Yoshino. I wasn't planning to leave Japan so soon, but I was leaving Osaka in a couple of weeks time to visit Okinawa.

After arriving at the station, I started making my way up the mountain, through the lines of small shops. I call them tourist traps, but pretty much every store of the sort in Japan is a tourist trap.

Fortunately, it was sunny throughout the day, so I was able to enjoy my time there. There were a couple of temples in the area, including one with the oldes cherry tree of the mountain, so I went to check those out before making my way back to the viewing area.

Once I got to the viewing area, it was pretty crowded, as most tourist places are in Japan. People there are big fans of family day trips.
But regardless of the number of people there, I managed to find a seat. And for a short while, I got to forget all my worries and disapointments. The struggles and work that I put into being able to afford this trip felt worth it. A week later, I would find out about my mom's cancer, which would force me to come back from my trip earlier, right after leaving Okinawa.

I was nervous in the beginning but as the interview went on, I started coming out of my shell and felt comfortable sharing my thoughts and opinions. I did not get immediate feedback from them but they told me that I would hear back in about a week. About a week later, I get a call from a lady in HR saying I got the job! I was over the moon. The best part about the entire experience was the fact that this happened in May and my job started September 1st, meaning I had the entire summer to relax and recuperate after spending a year job-hunting. During summer, I get an email from my boss wishing us a warm welcome and that they are looking forward to us joining them shortly. I felt very warm and welcomed at the time.

609fa46350e47e8c8a5fb830;Ending a long romantic relationship;Truthful;0;"This event took place in the city of Johannesburg, about 8 - 10 months ago, At the time I was in a situation with someone named Samantha. For the first half of the year, things were great between us. Unfortunately my sister fell sick and I had to return back home and assess the situation before I could go back to Johannesburg. Whilst I was back home I slowly started to notice slow and gradual changes in Samantha's behavior and mood. At first I didn't think much of it, but the longer I was away, the more I started suspecting something was happening in the city.
Luckily for me, my cousin was my eyes and ears because they were around the same functions often. It didn't take long before he came back to me with information. I had called and asked what the word was, he said he's been seeing her with a certain individual more and more...

My heart sank to my stomach, I knew ii wouldn't ask her about it directly. After plenty of contemplating, I decided the it would be best to tackle the matter once I was back. So, after 3 months of not being around, the boy (myself) had finally returned to the city. Of course she played it cool and acted as if nothing happened but I just kept gathering my information on the low. Eventually one day I confronted her about it and she denied everything (she surprisingly gas-lit me more than I anticipating). Long story short, we abruptly cut contact about 2 months after that incident.";event take place city johannesburg 8 10 month ago time situation name samantha half year thing great unfortunately sister fall sick return home assess situation johannesburg whilst home slowly start notice slow gradual change samantha behavior mood think long away started suspect happen city luckily cousin eye ear function long come information call ask word say see certain individual heart sink stomach know ii ask directly plenty contemplate decide good tackle matter 3 month boy finally return city course play cool act happen keep gather information low eventually day confront deny surprisingly gas light anticipate long story short abruptly cut contact 2 month incident;8;0.0995024875621891;3.625;3.0;2.875

Since my mom had been learning for a while she was now practicing what she had learnt on the road which wasn't a busy road at all. Unfortunately something bad happened. There was a truck in front of our car and that truck randomly stopped and since my mom wasn't that experienced she wasn't able to hit the brakes so the car smashed into the truck. The car was badly damaged to the extent that my dad sold it the very same day because he didn't have the money to fix it. And ever since that incident we have never had a car at our home. That's why it's memorable to me. It was the last time we ever had a car to call our own.;people involve car accident dad mom i. normal day dad teach mom drive driver seat mom passenger seat dad tag sit seat mom learn practice learn road busy road unfortunately bad happen truck car truck randomly stop mom experienced able hit brake car smash truck car badly damage extent dad sell day money fix incident car home memorable time car;5;0.733542319749216;5.0;5.0;5.0

In all honestly I have done this before hence I was not stressing about it, turns out management has stopped this because apparently people got too comfortable and ended up running away without paying the money, so now I was stranded.

This happened 6 months ago, but I didn't realize it until the person responsible for checking the train tickets, checked my pass and told me that it was not valid.
I don't usually carry money with me, and the trains I take (which are the cheaper ones), don't accept payments with cards. So the man checking the ticket told me that I needed to leave on the next stop. The problem is: I had an exam that morning, so I really needed to be on that train.
To make a long story short, I almost had to beg the person to let me continue on the train, but he didn't budge. I was probably sounding really desperate, because a really nice person next to me offered to pay my ticket, and I was able to ride the train.

I was holding my very first baby, I felt so many emotions and feelings, it was like love at first sight, I felt complete just holding her in my arms, it was like my whole world just changed and I could see a piece of me breathing. God, it was so wonderful, then the doctors finished up and the nurses took my baby and told me I’ll see her after the surgery. After surgery I was still weary of the medication but once I woke up, the 1st thing I asked for was my little princess, holding her was like holding a piece of my heart and that comforted me.

She never lost the willing of live despite a lot of sufference and she did her bet for a life and death in dignity, like when choosed - already terminal - to have a surgery after a thighbone fracture. When doctors say you have 50-70% to die if operated, it's not easy to choose, but the alternative was even more dramatic and without any hope.
She came back to walk with her own legs before to die. But was too much. It was a delicate balance and an incredible effort for her, myself and our families. She died after yet another short hospitalitazione. Situation worsened in one day. I was with her in hospital when died and at the same time with my wife all time at phone. In that very moment, was a mix love and relief. For reasons too deep and complex to describe, there was this bound, not only cause she was my mother and I loved, but cause I saved her life in the past and I was committed to do all my best to follow her during illness. I sacrificed much for this, much of my life and much of life togheter with my beloved wife. 
It was important cause I slowly understood to care more of myself and the people I love in a healthy way. And to accept the life is short but too beautiful to be wasted";day february someway expect unexpected terminal phase illness month month death fully aware condition fully conscious mind despite inevitable outcome old age want know truth illness condition treatment lose willing live despite lot sufference bet life death dignity like choose terminal surgery thighbone fracture doctor 50 70 die operate easy choose alternative dramatic hope come walk leg die delicate balance incredible effort family die short hospitalitazione situation worsen day hospital die time wife time phone moment mix love relief reason deep complex describe bind cause mother love cause save life past committed good follow illness sacrifice life life togheter beloved wife important cause slowly understand care people love healthy way accept life short beautiful waste;3;0.513888888888889;4.0;3.33333333333333;2.3333333333333335

During the same timeframe, my department was experiencing its busiest month in the year thus far. I was advised by an employee in a managerial position to not push myself so hard since the overall project deadline was actually flexible and that my individual task would actually only be due at a much later time than the official deadline given. Though well liked, this manager was known for being inefficient so I had reason to believe that a second opinion would be needed to confirm this statement. I chose not to inquire. I chose to take the words at face value, even when I overheard daily complaints about impeding deadlines for different tasks given to other colleagues for the same project. No one else could have spoken about my task because of how specific it was and how work is distributed individually. When I had decided to start completing my task I chose to pause in favor of participating in a seminar I had applied to attend and was subsequently chosen for. My excuse was that my individual task was due when the manager had said so it was not outstanding although I made no actions to confirm.

It was at this moment I realised that I need to eliminate my competition. I began introducing myself to each candidate and asking each one about their background and experience. I then pretended to have inside information and mention that I knew someone who worked there. This was a calculated move on my part in diminishing the confidence of the competition. I knew that if they believed I already had a foot in the door, a part of them will discouraged. Since this was the job of my dreams, I was willing and able to take all the necessary steps to secure my position at this company. When I went into the interview room I was confident in knowing that I would stand out among the other candidates. I had also done research on the company and was able to discuss the current business ventures the company has embarked on as well as highlight my interest, skills and values matching their expectations. The interviewers seemed to be pretty impressed by the interview.

The lessons were casual and everybody used to chat while we waited for our turn to drive. During one of these chats I let slip that I was in therapy for some mental health struggles, one of which is ADHD. We knew our driving instructor to be a person who alternates between being verbally abusive and being a calm teacher. On one morning he began picking on a new student and trying to get everyone in on it, I told him he wasn't being kind and should rethink how he treats people because his behaviour was unwarranted. The fact that I called him out must have upset him because he redirected his anger at me and called me the 'r' slur. I called him out for being rude again and told him that is not a proper way to speak to people. Instead of apologising or taking it back, he doubled down and called me that word again for even expecting an apology.

6082c924dd13d8ec285f751f;Ending a long romantic relationship;Truthful;0;"I studied abroad for 10 months last year and by then I hadn't had a romantic relationship before. I was told that I shouldn't fall in love while in there since long distance relationships are hard and I was totally fine with that since I thought ""If I haven't had a date in 20 years, that won't change in here"" but I was wrong. In my second semester I met a person that changed everything, suddenly I was open to have a long distence relationship if it was with them. 
We dated for 3 months in person and 3 months while being ""long distence"". Obviously I had a lot of memorable moments with this person not only because we met in another country and we had several options to go on dates and discover the country together but also because it was my firts relationship ever and they were the first person I had ever held hands with, kissed, etc. 
They meant the world to me but sadly we ended up breaking up because long distance was very hard for them and they thought that we wouldn't work like that for much longer. I was devastated by these news since I was already planning on visiting them and all that. We had plans and well, I was pretty much in love. I remember this very well because I don't think I have ever experiences so much emotional pain in my entire life. It might sounds dramatic but it is true. I cried for weeks, it was the only thing I could think and talk about and to be honest I was sad not only because things ended but also because I couldn't hate them. If they had cheated or treated me badly or whatever, I at least could have been able to hate them and move on but in my head they were good to me even when letting me go so I was still in love after months. 
Nowadays I think I moved on but still I regret some things that we did and things we never did as well. I don't think I will never love someone again or aomething like that but I feel a bit hopeless since I have never met someone that special and I don't think that will happen again soon.

We then proceeded to speak on Whatsapp as it was easier and we didnt have to be proffessional. We both fell inlove without even meeting at first.
He made his first move by sending me coffee and cake. I then sent him a letter saying thank you with a home cooked meal. He then asked if we could meet up. He kept postponing and I got mad and thought why would he even do the things he does, like send me flowers and food everyday and not want to meet me in person.

I'd only been to another concert before 6 years prior, so this was a big a deal to me, not only because I was very excited to be spending a day with a friend at a concert, but also because it was the last concert of the ""Love on Tour"" so there were rumours going around about what was supposed to happen during the exhibition. Well, it was both extremely fun and somewhat dreadful. 102.000 people attended the concert, which was one of the best concert I ever went to. Harry Stiles sang beautifully and with such a passion, including also a couple of songs from his One Direction era, during which I was a teenager, so when I heard those songs I went crazy. Plus, the vibes were immaculate, a lot of people were having fun and it was overall an amazing experience, I have a lot of videos of that night. The dreadfull part came when it was time to get home. The concert ended at around midnight, and my friend's sister was supposed to pick us up, but she couldn't get access to our location because of police blocks around the venue, that would block cars from getting inside the perimeter to allow who was inside to get outside. So we walked for an hour to get to a bar, to buy some water because we were without, and than we sat and waited for about two hours, before realizing that we would have to move and reach a location were someone could pick us up. We decided to get moving, and we started to walk to reach the train station, which wasn't part of the perimeter blocked by police. To reach the train station we had to walk for one hour and a half in complete darkness, with only the torches of our phones, which were almost out of battery. When we reached the train station we immediately hopped on the car that was waiting for us, then in took us another 30 minutes or so to reach home.

I had assumed it was another driver which I hadn't yet met, so I smiled up at him, only for him to reveal a gun under his overall shirt. I froze immediately and I could tell from the tension in the office that they did not know who this guy was. He was there with 2 other guys who were addressing some of my other colleagues. He then roughly directed everyone in the office to the boardroom...where my boss was being assaulted by another one of their guys. My colleagues and I were told to sit on the boardroom floor during which time they started assaulting my manager along with my boss asking for the office safe. Due to the boss's lack of co-operation, the robbers continued to attack the boss and manager demanding for the safe.

For these kind of occasions I had a ready-made method to avoid getting caught, and that was having my smartphone ready to buy the ticket and to change the time so it looked like I bought it earlier than in reality. 
That was the only time I did not do that, and that was the time the ticket inspectors got on the bus, and I had no chance to escape, not even getting off at the bus stop where they got on. That day I was on the bus to go to a friend of mine's house and I had to get off the bus at the train station stop since he lives around that area. I also had what looked like a little suitcase with some of my clothes and stuff in it since I was going to spend the night at his house.
When the inspectors got to me, I told them right off I had no ticket, and I invented the whole ""I have to catch a train to go to my girlfriend's city"" story, which has actually a real basis since I have a long-distance relationship and I had proof of that for them. The driver, and it was not the first time it happened, covered for me telling them I actually got on the earlier stop when I actually caught the bus at least 4 stops earlier.

In the middle of march, less than a month through my journey into placement, I was asked to facilitate a group therapy program for court mandated men who have a link between drugs and alcohol and previous offending. Remarkably, this clinic had never asked a student to run the group before but they had great confidence in me. What I didn't know at the time was that this group therapy was going to be the most challenging but rewarding three months of my life. The men were very stand offish and completely disengaged at the beginning of the session - there was also 15 of them for us two young female facilitators. These guys were not afraid to tell us their honest truths about their thoughts on the group. Through the 15 3-hour long sessions, the group dwindled down to 4 men who showed incredible change. Not only had they abstained from drugs but they were open about their responsibility for their offences, and some admit opening up about their feelings and thoughts in a way they never had before. By the end we had grown close and they were all incredibly complementary about my facilitating and my empathy.;psychology student placement drug alcohol counselling clinic middle march month journey placement ask facilitate group therapy program court mandate man link drug alcohol previous offending remarkably clinic ask student run group great confidence know time group therapy go challenging rewarding month life man stand offish completely disengage beginning session 15 young female facilitator guy afraid tell honest truth thought group 15 3 hour long session group dwindle 4 man show incredible change abstain drug open responsibility offence admit opening feeling thought way end grow close incredibly complementary facilitating empathy;5;0.363636363636364;1.8;2.2;3.4

I visited him 3 times during the relationship with each trip lasting 2-3 weeks. He was very insecure about his sexuality and because he was living in a country where it was illegal to be homosexual, he was anxious that our relationship would put his job at risk. I would reassure him that it was absolutely fine but he didn't believe me. Towards the end of the relationship, he became very distant and his attitude towards me changed.

6074de03363deb52b54eccf4;Being involved in a car accident;Truthful;0;"The acidente occurred about 8 monts ago, at around 8:00 pm in the pasteleira nighborhood in Portugal, while I was working as a courier. My girlfriend was sitting next to me in the car. I was walking down a street, heading towards a restaurant to collect an order, when a car in front of me suddenly stopped. The driver was startled by a van that was reversing from distance. Despite the van being far away, the driver in front of me stopped abruptly for no apparent reason. I tried to react quickly and brake, but the road was slippery, causing my car to slide and collide with the back of the lady's car who had braked hard. My car sustained damage: a broken headlight and a shrunk mudguard. The lady's car had slight damage to the rear bumper. The van, on the other hand, did not suffer any damage.
After the colision, we called the police. The lady claimed that the accidente was the fault of the man in the van, as his prohibited maneuver caused her to brake suddenly. When the ploice arrived, we povided our statements. The offices informed me that the insurance might likely blame me for the accident, given the circumstances. After the police left, the lady and I went to a nearby gas station to fill out a friendly accident report. Once that was completed, I took my girlfriend home and then went to my house as well.
Reflecting on the incident, I realize that despite my efforts to avoid the collision, the slippery road conditions and the suddent stop by the driver in front were significant factores. The entire experience was stressful, from the initial shock of the collision to dealing with the police and filling out the accident report. It was a stark reminder of how unpredictable driving can be and the importance of staying vigilant at all times, even when the actions of other drivers are unexpected.";acidente occur 8 mont ago 8:00 pm pasteleira nighborhood portugal work courier girlfriend sit car walk street head restaurant collect order car suddenly stop driver startle van reverse distance despite van far away driver stop abruptly apparent reason try react quickly brake road slippery cause car slide collide lady car brake hard car sustain damage broken headlight shrunk mudguard lady car slight damage rear bumper van hand suffer damage colision call police lady claim accidente fault man van prohibit maneuver cause brake suddenly ploice arrive povide statement office inform insurance likely blame accident give circumstance police leave lady go nearby gas station fill friendly accident report complete take girlfriend home go house reflect incident realize despite effort avoid collision slippery road condition suddent stop driver significant factore entire experience stressful initial shock collision deal police fill accident report stark reminder unpredictable driving importance stay vigilant time action driver unexpected;15;0.188811188811189;4.0;3.6;4.266666666666667

608d5c3d033ac9b6f0c7cfa4;None of them;Truthful;0;I was attending my first ECT treatment at the public hospital. The appointment was scheduled at 8 AM, and I was really nervous because I only read bad things about this treatment and how makes people feel. I was also told that, if I don't have anyone to be with me or accompany me, they will send me to the hospital ward, because this is the protocol when general anesthesia is used. I insisted I didn't want to stay in ward because it was unnecessary, and I had a cat to take care in my apartment. However, after going through the ECT treatment I was directly sent to the ward. The ward booked for me was in the same building, so a nurse came and took my bed gurney through the hospital hallways until my room. I remember thinking that the nurse looked stylish, she had black hair and bangs, she was mid age, and I think she had either a nice necklace or bracelets, can't remember specifically, but I remember the noise it made. The hospital was recently constructed so the ward room looked very nice. It had a big sliding door. I remember the room called my attention because of all the hospital panels with buttons and stuffs I didn't know why or how were used. I felt that I was being a waste of resources, that I felt great and that could go home, that all of this wasn't needed. The room also had an armchair and desk, and a big window. The bathroom door was also sliding door, and the bathroom itself was quite big. The first meal that I was given was the breakfast, because for ECT I needed to fast, so even thought it wasn't time for breakfast, they gave me oatmeal, yogurt and I think a juice and banana. I was feeling very bad because I didn't want to be there, and I started having headaches, so everything felt unbearable. The lunch was some kind of fish stew, and I didn't reject it even though I'm vegetarian. It was the first time I ate fish in many, many years. I didn't want to bother the nurses with this, so I just sucked it up and ate it anyways, because I knew if the plate was full they would just throw it and waste food too. In the afternoon I tried to nap but I wasn't able, because the bed was so uncomfortable and made noise because of the plastic covers. My headache got worse and I was getting really irritated, it really felt like hell at that moment. The nurses were visiting me every few hours to take my temperature and check on my state, I guess because they were told to? In the evening for some reason I started having fever, and around 2 am the nurses woke me up again to take my temperature and give me some pills to feel better. I wasn't allowed to go home until the next day morning, when a doctor checked on me and gave the OK to go. I was in so much annoyance because I could have gone home the day before, sleep well, stay with my cat, and much more.;attend ect treatment public hospital appointment schedule 8 nervous read bad thing treatment make people feel tell accompany send hospital ward protocol general anesthesia insist want stay ward unnecessary cat care apartment go ect treatment directly send ward ward book building nurse come take bed gurney hospital hallway room remember think nurse look stylish black hair bang mid age think nice necklace bracelet remember specifically remember noise hospital recently construct ward room look nice big slide door remember room call attention hospital panel button stuff know feel waste resource feel great home need room armchair desk big window bathroom door slide door bathroom big meal give breakfast ect need fast think time breakfast give oatmeal yogurt think juice banana feel bad want start have headache feel unbearable lunch kind fish stew reject vegetarian time eat fish year want bother nurse suck eat anyways know plate throw waste food afternoon try nap able bed uncomfortable noise plastic cover headache get bad get irritated feel like hell moment nurse visit hour temperature check state guess tell evening reason start have fever 2 nurse wake temperature pill feel well allow home day morning doctor check give ok annoyance go home day sleep stay cat;9;0.460843373493976;4.22222222222222;3.77777777777778;4.111111111111111

They also asked if there was anything I would change about the environment and I gave a few very vague suggestions. Even though the meeting felt odd to me (they were taking notes the entire time) I dismissed it and moved on. Later that same day they called me in for another meeting and this time HR was present too. They said that a co-worker told them that I had been complaining about the work environment and that I said I hated working there (amongst other things). I denied everything and asked who said those things, but they refused to say who it was. They then coerced me into quitting and said if I don't like it there then they won't keep me against my will and that I should go somewhere I would be happier.

I was lucky enough that I wasnt the only student who had the same problem. We had to submit it bt the 29th because on may 5th we had a practice run of the presentation part of it. And since she didnt check my work, i wasnt let through with the other student. And when we tried to contact our dean, she wasnt very helpful with the situation either. Hope was almost lost. But right when i had accepted my faith, that im not finishing university this year, i got an email back, that i can show my work and present it soo i can be let through. Somehow my program director had found a way for me and the other students to show our work for another day. And everything worked out in the end.

6133a97236d89cffd20e5fa4;Being involved in a car accident;Truthful;0;About half a year ago, I happened to be using the transport provided by work for staff as our family car had to undergo repairs. Ten minutes into the ride home on the highway, we heard loud popping sound, something resembling a gunshot, and before we knew what was happening, the car we were in veered off its lane and drove across the next lane and into the bushes on the side of the highway. As you can imagine, while all this was happening we were screaming in terror and making desperate efforts to somehow exit the vehicle, all in vain of course. When the car finally came to a standstill, we noticed that one of our male colleagues had been thrown out of the car through the windscreen, and now lay just in front of our stationery vehicle with blood trickling from his nose, ears and mouth. We all saw this when we exited the vehicle and a wave of utter silence washed over everyone present as we stared at the motionless body of our colleague in complete disbelief. Everybody else, including myself, was experiencing minor body pains and no serious injuries were evident. What followed after that was just a blur to me as I was quite traumatized at what had just happened. Shortly after the accident, paramedics, policemen and a lot of other people arrived and we were taken to the hospital for examinations, and this is where we learned that our poor colleague had unfortunately not survived that horrible accident. It has been 6 months since this happened but I still think of it quite often. We were later informed that it was due to one of the rear tyres bursting, and I cannot help but blame whoever's responsibility it was to ensure that the car was in perfect order before driving out. Very sad indeed.;half year ago happen transport provide work staff family car undergo repair minute ride home highway hear loud popping sound resemble gunshot know happen car veer lane drive lane bush highway imagine happen scream terror make desperate effort exit vehicle vain course car finally come standstill notice male colleague throw car windscreen lay stationery vehicle blood trickle nose ear mouth see exit vehicle wave utter silence wash present stare motionless body colleague complete disbelief everybody include experience minor body pain injury evident follow blur traumatized happen shortly accident paramedic policeman lot people arrive take hospital examination learn poor colleague unfortunately survive horrible accident 6 month happen think later inform rear tyre burst help blame responsibility ensure car perfect order drive sad;4;0.0590551181102362;3.0;3.0;2.25

The job posting had rigorous application requirements including an English test, writing an essay, and sending voice notes. My confidence increased as I went through the process (which had me working on it in the wee hours of the morning), and by the end of my application, I was confident I had what it takes. I prayed over the job for so long and thought I'd at least have the interview to prove myself if my application was subpar.

5d96dc63334c5c00175db42c;None of them;Truthful;0;My partner and I took up playing Bridge a year ago and took classes after which we joined a club. We had entered some tournaments which for us as novices meant that we were playing more experienced players and whilst providing good experience , we were not anywhere close to the prizes. Finally a day came when a National Novice tournament was to be played. Bridge is a game played in a team of two where the initial part is bidding for the amount of tricks that a team will win. This bidding is used also to communicate between a team as to the contents of their hands as verbal and visual signals are prohibited.Once the bidding is over  the cards are played out to see if a team can make their 'contract' , improve or fail. Each team in the room is trying to do better than all the others and play differing hands and opponents. At the bidding stage a team communicates via the bidding , using pre-agreed bidding systems to which their opponents must be made aware at the outset.Towards the end of the tournament , my partner made a bid which did not suit my hand at all. I responded with a bid which was ambiguous and required one of two specific responses under our bidding system. My partner responded under one of the alternatives and   victory in that hand was crucial for winning the tournament as we were lying second at that point. However we should not have won the hand as it was bad play on the part of that particular opponent that gave us victory as we were in an unsuitable contract for our cards. My partner subsequently told me that he had seen my expression twist on seeing his bid and knew that it was not suitable , but was forced to reply as per our system as otherwise it could be classified as cheating. We won the tournament but only through sheer luck which was very memorable.;partner take play bridge year ago take class join club enter tournament novice mean play experienced player whilst provide good experience close prize finally day come national novice tournament play bridge game play team initial bid trick team win bidding communicate team content hand verbal visual signal prohibit bidding card play team contract improve fail team room try well play differ hand opponent bidding stage team communicate bidding pre agreed bidding system opponent aware outset end tournament partner bid suit hand respond bid ambiguous require specific response bidding system partner respond alternative victory hand crucial win tournament lie second point win hand bad play particular opponent give victory unsuitable contract card partner subsequently tell see expression twist see bid know suitable force reply system classify cheat win tournament sheer luck memorable;1;0.0520833333333333;5.0;5.0;1.0

6011c91e496f2f16d61402e7;A job interview for your dream job;Truthful;0;"I arrived at the office building feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness for my interview with TechInnovate, a leading company in AI development. After checking in at the reception, I was led to a conference room where I met the interview panel, consisting of the HR manager, the team lead, and a senior developer.

The interview began with the HR manager asking about my previous experiences. I described my role as a junior developer at my last company, where I assisted in various projects. I mentioned my contributions to an AI-driven marketing campaign, where I supported the team by testing and debugging the algorithm. Although I wasn't the project lead, my work helped ensure the project's success.

Next, the team lead asked about my technical skills. I talked about my experience with Python and my growing knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I shared that I had worked on a project to develop a predictive analytics model, though it was a collaborative effort, and I mainly focused on data preprocessing and initial model training.

The senior developer then inquired about a specific challenge I had faced. I recounted a time when we encountered a bug in our code just before a minor product update. I worked with my team to identify the problem, and together we implemented a fix that resolved the issue. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and attention to detail.

Back when we all lived around the same city we made it a point that at least twice a month we would go out to a local bar and watch games together. So as we had Mark is moving around the same city we living we figured that it is the perfect time to what we used to in the past.

613b45335ef9d60c2f15bb86;None of them;Truthful;0;I was going through a very dark season in my life. I was very depressed. During that time, i would experience dissociation a lot especially at night. I was even having suicidal thoughts. I remember that every night I would struggle with the thought of killing myself and some nights I would even go out and stand on top on a tall building. My therapist whom I was seeing at the time would help me deal with this and He gave me his numbers and some emergency numbers to contact when I was not feeling well. One night on the 15th of September 2023, I was at my worst. I had never been that worse before and I had decided in my mind that I was going to kill myself. Before doing that, I went to have sex with this other guy that used to be my sex partner. Back then, I would use sex to escape from my depression. Usually after having sex, I would feel good. But this particular day, I felt even worse. And when I left his room, I went to jump off the building I was staying in but fortunately, the rooftop door was locked so I couldn't access it. I then decided to text my therapist to tell him about what was going on. He surprisingly replied very fast and we talked. He helped me calm down and arranged for me to go to a hospital that night. When I went to the hospital, I explained everything and they took me to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD and gave me the appropriate pills. After some days of taking the pills, I was feeling really really good and I had energy to do all the things I loved again. This event is so memorable to me because it still feels unreal and when I think back, I just realize of how I could not be here today if the rooftop was open, but here I am.;go dark season life depressed time experience dissociation lot especially night have suicidal thought remember night struggle thought kill night stand tall building therapist see time help deal give number emergency number contact feel night 15th september 2023 bad bad decide mind go kill go sex guy sex partner use sex escape depression usually have sex feel good particular day feel bad leave room go jump building stay fortunately rooftop door lock access decide text therapist tell go surprisingly reply fast talk help calm arrange hospital night go hospital explain take psychiatrist psychiatrist diagnose bpd give appropriate pill day take pill feel good energy thing love event memorable feel unreal think realize today rooftop open;2;0.30327868852459;5.0;4.5;3.0

The project was on a downturn for some months at this point so me and the team already knew there was a possibility of all shutting down. 

The day came on the 1st of September. A meeting was announced for that day on Discord, the platform we moods use to work. In this meeting we had all the mods, the CEO Anthony, the community manager Kiki and Tess another member of the upper management team. 

Anthony did all the talking basically and explained from the beginning what was happening and why it was happening. He basically explained that the project was not making money and because of that almost everyone would be let go. 

He also proceeded to say this wasn´t the end and that the project would continue as some members would acquire the project and still work on it. 

Was a pretty dry reunion for the occasion to be honest. I already this would happen so it didn´t strike me right away, although it was awful as I loved the job and it was paid very very well. 

Some of the mods and Poco our ex community manager and Kiki our current community manager had our little meeting afterward to talk bad about Tess and the team basically. I sold all my NFT´s and told everybody to do the same because there was no way the project would be successful now.

I had to memorize a lot of dates and years and a few hours before the exam I somehow forgot a lot of dates, even though I knew them the day before. So I took a pen and I wrote around 5-8 dates on my palm. During the exam I had managed to look on my palm and the professor had no idea. But then one of my colleagues got caught using his phone during the exam. The professor got mad and took his exam. He started going around the classroom looking for other cheaters. When he was behind my desk and a few meters away I heard him yell my name and he started walking towards me. I got really scared because I thought he had found out about my cheating. But when he got to me I was relieved because he told me that my water bottle was leaking from my bag.

I decided to have the surgery primarily to repair separated abdominal muscles following multiple pregnancies but also to boost my self-confidence. Although I was calm and collected during the approaching weeks of the surgery, the morning of the procedure I was extremely nervous. I felt selfish for undergoing elective surgery due to the impact of my lengthy recovery on my young family. The hospital team made me feel at ease and I was in the operating room within 90 minutes of my arrival at the hospital. The surgery was undertaken at a private hospital so the care and service I received was outstanding and could not be faulted. I felt well looked after throughout the whole experience. The procedure took approximately four and a half hours and went without complication. I did not experience nausea or any other issues related to general anaesthesia and was taken to my room soon after waking up. The worst part of the experience was being nil-by-mouth prior to surgery. Due to past medical complications involving post-surgical blood clots the team wanted me to mobilise soon after surgery, so within a few hours I was out of bed. I had done plenty of research prior  to surgery as to what to expect immediately following surgery and during the recovery period but experiencing it myself was different entirely despite my preparation. I was not prepared for exactly how painful it would be. Getting up and down and moving by myself was difficult. The experience was memorable for me because I had waited a very long  time to have the procedure and spent a long time saving money for it, and I was relieved to finally have it done.;week ago undergo elective surgery abdominoplasty procedure decide surgery primarily repair separate abdominal muscle follow multiple pregnancy boost self confidence calm collect approach week surgery morning procedure extremely nervous feel selfish undergo elective surgery impact lengthy recovery young family hospital team feel ease operating room 90 minute arrival hospital surgery undertake private hospital care service receive outstanding fault feel look experience procedure take approximately half hour go complication experience nausea issue relate general anaesthesia take room soon wake bad experience nil mouth prior surgery past medical complication involve post surgical blood clot team want mobilise soon surgery hour bed plenty research prior surgery expect immediately follow surgery recovery period experience different entirely despite preparation prepare exactly painful get move difficult experience memorable wait long time procedure spend long time save money relieve finally;3;0.157509157509158;3.66666666666667;3.0;3.0

661fcbe312c3c3769a21fbe6;Taking the bus/train without the ticket;Truthful;0;"About 6 months ago I booked a train to Douai, only a few cities over from where I live. At first, I did actually buy a ticket for the trip but when I showed up to the train station, my train was cancelled. So I bought another ticket for the next train but that one ended up being delayed nearly an hour. At that point I felt like I had spent too much on tickets and I wasn't willing to buy another ticket and risk it being cancelled too so I got on the next train to Douai without buying a ticket.

Once I got on the train, I waited anxiously during the 20-minute trip because I was worried that someone would be going through the train checking tickets, and while I had the old tickets for the trains that were cancelled/delayed with me, I was worried that I'd get a fine for not having a ticket for that specific train.

Thankfully, no one came through to check my ticket and I got off at my stop without any issues.

I was travelling alone that day and it was memorable for me because I'm not usually one to break the rules like that and risk a fine, but at that point, I think I'd spent nearly 20 euros on tickets and didn't want to waste any more money even though I was planning on requesting a refund for those tickets later on.";6 month ago book train douai city live actually buy ticket trip show train station train cancel buy ticket train end delay nearly hour point feel like spend ticket willing buy ticket risk cancel get train douai buy ticket get train wait anxiously 20 minute trip worried go train checking ticket old ticket train cancel delay worried fine have ticket specific train thankfully come check ticket get stop issue travel day memorable usually break rule like risk fine point think spend nearly 20 euro ticket want waste money plan request refund ticket later;2;0.4453125;4.5;5.0;2.0

The interviewers made me feel inadequate in some parts, and I was sure I wouldn't get a call back for a second interview, but I did.
The second interview was more difficult because I discovered in the interview that I knew one of the interviewers, he was a junior colleague in my organization in his previous employ and has since moved on to a much higher position and was now interviewing me.
 What I thought was the worst, I was successful in the interview and I was offered the job, however I couldn't take it because it was a 2 year contract position and my husband did not want to risk the of me being unemployed after 2 years, considering the current job market and the state of the economy.

I didn´t mind even if I had to spend several days studying the matters because this was something I really wanted to do. I was approved in every test, until the final interview arrived.

However, I wasn't too worried and was just really relieved that the cancerous growth had been found early before it had time to spread, and I wanted it removed asap. The surgeon takes it out with wide margins to avoid any spreading so its quite a big portion of tissue that is removed compared to normal skin lesion removal. The operation went very well, and afterwards it was quite tender and sore at the wound site. However, within a couple of days I had almost forgotten about it. I attended a follow-up appointment with the plastic surgeon and he was delighted with the healing taking place.

After contacting the police and my parents, I stood waiting for them to arrive while the person who caused the accident (foreigner on vacation) contacted her friend or carer or whatever. The police officer asked me some questions for a bit, and then we went to the insurance company, where the representative told me that they couldn't do anything because they don't deal with foreign insurance companies, such as the one used by the woman who crashed into my family's car. 

Eventually we managed to get at least some financial settlement, but due to the age of our car we didn't get enough compensation to even begin to cover repairs or to purchase a brand new car. The worst part of it all is that now my family has another heavy monthly expense to deal with, and it has been part of the reason why my family has been struggling with money for a while.

I did not even make it to the interview, this was a knock to my ego because I was always the overachiever in my previous work positions and I never failed an assessment or interview prior to this experience.";submit apply dream job receive email state application accept continue assessment stage initially think application unsuccessful receive reply week communication state receive response 7 day imagine excitement receive acceptance email email state complete assessment interview order proceed final selection stage assessment follow english assessment comprehension assessment video interview long story short take 3 day prepare fail english assessment work 2 year come surprise touch realise need sharpen skill apply interview knock ego overachiever previous work position fail assessment interview prior experience;1;0.0342465753424658;5.0;5.0;5.0

My classmate was better prepared than I was. She had covered all the chapters. During the exam we were sitting very close to each other, we could basically read what the other person had written on their exam paper without much effort. We talked frequently during the exam because the professor wasn't very attentive. There were 2 o 3 questions on the exam that I knew absolutely nothing about as they were about the last chapter. Thankfully my classmate had studied those topics and I just copied her  answers for those questions. There were some answers that she wasn't very confident about, so she copied some sentences from me. I'm really happy that we were sitting so close to each other and we could consult each other during the exam. I would have failed if my classmate hadn't let me copy her answers. We both passed.

I had options I could choose from like ceramic and others which I don't even recall.

60d0da6d77e686a54bb6d3fe;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Truthful;0;"What happened:
We were assigned to a client to audit for the duration of 3 weeks. the deadline was tight due to the amount of work that needed to be done within the 3 weeks period. As a senior on the job I had put a work plan in place for everyone to follow. I was supposed to follow up on everyone to ensure that they are following the work plan.
When the team members gave me an update on their sections I was not going into those sections to confirm that whatever they say has been done has been done.
As a result of not following up i found out towards the end of the audit that the feedback given to me was not accurate or was not a true reflection of the job done.
We ended up asking the client for additional time in order to finalize our audit and this resulted to me as a senior having to take responsibility for everyone's fault. I was ask to explain to the manager and the partner on the job. this took about 2 hours explaining what went wrong.

Who was involved:
It was me and the two junior audit assistance on the job. the manager and the partner were just the to supervise and sign off on the financials once the audit is completed.
This event took place in the office as we were not conducting the audit from the client premises. it took place on the 22 of April 2024.

I use  a monthly subscription based type of pass that allows me to use the bus as many times as I want until the expiration date that is displayed on the card. The truth is that I was well aware that the card expired and I tried to save as much money as I could until the next payment. To be fair, I took advantage of the underperforming inspectors or my country, as they are rarely seen. I had made that story up on my mind in case I got caught but I actually did not raise any suspicions. I showed the pass the driver before boarding but as I expected he did not pay any attention to details (e.g. expiration date).;background story remain use monthly subscription base type pass allow use bus time want expiration date display card truth aware card expire try save money payment fair take advantage underperform inspector country rarely see story mind case get catch actually raise suspicion show pass driver boarding expect pay attention detail e.g. expiration date;4;0.214285714285714;3.5;3.5;2.0

Considering I didn't even attend university myself and was coming to the industry from a Fashion background it was such an honour to even be considered for the opportunity.

In the run up to the interview I resisted the urge to share my news for fear of jinxing it and went to the interview with no one around me knowing what I was about to do. Once I arrived at the building it started to sink in, I was greeted at reception and shown to the interview room in which I was instructed to wait outside. Inside the room I could see two friendly looking women, I took a deep breath and thought ""I can do this"" then to my surprise a third seemingly less friendly woman entered the room, it was then that I began to doubt. I entered the room and attempted to keep my nerves at bay, my way is when in doubt fake it til you make it. The interview was comfortable and once introduced to the women I could feel the warm nature from them all, the questions were all manageable and I felt like I had answered the best that I could. I  said my goodbyes and left the building, it was then I took the opportunity to let my parents know about the interview. They were over the moon !

I thought all was ready and I went to look at my emails, then browsed through some videos on YouTube. I overindulged on the videos, apparently, because all of a sudden the alarm for getting ready for school went off. My kid was particularly reluctant to get dressed for school that day, it took a bit more of convincing than usual to get into his uniform. I check my clock and we are a few minutes behind schedule. no problem, I can make it. We rush out of the house and get him to his school on time. barely. I am now late for my morning meeting, I have to speed things up. I get  5 minutes late to the meeting though. A few emails, a few meetings more, some ground work, and its time to pick up my kid, all things go smooth from there on. Lunch, finish work, the wife gets home, dinner, movie, bed time, sleep. I suddenly wake up, something is not right, I forgot something. I look at my watch and its now Thursday, 2 a.m.

Wednesdays is time sheet submission day, and yesterday was the end of month submission period. I completely forgot about it. Never happened to me before, I had to go through hoops to get it fixed.

I was the one driving, and on our way to the hospital we picked up my cousin not very far from where I live so that we can go see our granny together and another factor was that using 1 car will save us much petrol. I was worried and driving over the speed limit, and unfortunately the traffic cops stopped us just before we got to the hospital. I tried explaining the situation to them but they didn't buy my story, instead the slapped me with a speeding ticket and  further told me was endangering people's lives.

6151a01be98c92d95d6f71ed;A job interview for your dream job;Truthful;0;I've been unemployed for the past 3 years and I am an active job seeker. I have my days were I'm tired and not motivated to apply. Being out of a job for a long times makes you wonder if you will ever be able to handle the office life, this is because you become used to doing things at your own time and in your own way, basically your life is flexible. This has made me take an interest in working remotely. I have been applying for remote jobs more than I apply for jobs that require you to be in the office. I have received positive feedback as I have been invited to a number of interviews which have been unsuccessful. I apply at JobDuck for the first didn't get a response. However, this didn't stop me because i applied for the second adhering to all the job application requirements, which included writing an essay and making a short recording introducing yourself. This time I made it to the interview stage, i was very excited I remember I started praying hard asking God to help me. I started preparing for the interview using the notes that I've created based on my previous Interviews. I would read these notes everyday until the day of the interview moreover, I even wrote them on my sticky notes thinking I would use them on the day of the interview. The interview was on zoom. I got a WhatsApp message asking me to schedule a day for my interview. I must say i really enjoyed the recruitment process as the team was very helpful and friendly. The day of the interview came and I was really nervous because I know that I'm not really good with selling myself and this was a one in a lifetime opportunity for me. The interview started and I was struggling to adjust sound setting on zoom while being guided by the interviewer which made me more nervous. Being the honest individual that I am I asked the interviewer if I could use my notes, she said she wouldn't advise me to do that, and I didn't. The interview proceeded and I forgot everything that I prepared as a result I didn't move on to the next stage. I was really disappointed as I know that once you've reached the interview stage changes of you getting another process are slim. I was sad for some time, tried seeking for feedback from the WhatsApp number I used to schedule my interview didn't get much of a response. After a week I reached out to the recruitment team seeking for feedback and I received it. I was told to work on my skills and apply again after 6 months. The feedback was highly appreciated as a lot of recruiters don't respond to such queries. This motivated me to work on my skills and increased my desire to work for the organization.;unemployed past 3 year active job seeker day tired motivate apply job long time make wonder able handle office life thing time way basically life flexible interest work remotely apply remote job apply job require office receive positive feedback invite number interview unsuccessful apply jobduck response stop apply second adhere job application requirement include write essay make short recording introduce time interview stage excited remember start pray hard ask god help start prepare interview note create base previous interviews read note everyday day interview write sticky note think use day interview interview zoom get whatsapp message ask schedule day interview enjoy recruitment process team helpful friendly day interview come nervous know good sell lifetime opportunity interview start struggle adjust sound set zoom guide interviewer nervous honest individual ask interviewer use note say advise interview proceed forget prepare result stage disappointed know reach interview stage change get process slim sad time try seek feedback whatsapp number schedule interview response week reach recruitment team seek feedback receive tell work skill apply 6 month feedback highly appreciate lot recruiter respond query motivate work skill increase desire work organization;6;0.476323119777159;4.66666666666667;4.0;5.0

616d59b55db3fef98c03d6db;None of them;Truthful;0;On the first week of February 2024 my sister, cousin sister, and I went to see our uncle who was not well for a while. He was our dads' brother so we have known him our entire lives. On that day he looked very pale and he couldn't solids, but he could talk. However, you could tell that even talking was hurting him. One of his daughters made fun of how his stomach was so smaller that usually. She's young and had no clue. When we left his house later that day, I prayed that God helps because seeing him like that hurt my feeling so much. My cousin accompanied him to the hospital following day, and she told me they didn't admit him so he went back home.

I was alone that Monday evening and I cried myself to sleep, so much that I woke up with swollen eyes the next day. I liedat work and said I didn't sleep well and that is the reason my eyes were like that. Almost every night since that Monday evening I'd cry before bed until after his funeral.

661fcba2a52176d3a7bdddce;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Truthful;0;I had a kidney operation about 23 months ago. I moved residence a month or so before and did not have anybody to help me. Both my children was in another city and I suppose I did not want to be a nuisance so I did not want to ask for help from people I barely knew. The hospital was a two hour drive from where I was living, in Mossel bay. This is the reason why I remember it so well because I had to drive myself to the hospital. The day before the operation I prepared by doing some food and snack shopping and I made sure that I had all the water I would need so that I would not be left in need without help. I left at 4am in the morning and admitted myself. The hospital staff was not very nice during my stay there (they were not very empathetic) and the operation itself was very painful. It hurt a lot and I was very nauseated because of the anesthesia.  At least the Doctor was nice. When he was busy with the release forms he realised that I was supposed to drive back home by myself and he then kept me in hospital another day to give my some extra time to rest and recover. The drive home the next day was very unpleasant and I recall stopping at each town along the way for a 20 min rest.  I was fortunate that there was really amazing rest stops at 3 of the towns that I passed, so I was able to get out, use the bathroom and take a powernap in the back of my car.

6649ec78b653af2aea562697;None of them;Truthful;0;"I have long wanted another dog. I've had two family dogs previously and they meant everything to me. They were my best friends. They kept my depression at bay. After I lost my first dog I didn't want another dog because I couldn't bare feeling that loss. I didn't have a say in getting another dog. One day he was just there. I wasn't told before hand. Although I resent not being told before hand and not being considered about experiencing that loss again I couldn't be happier that my second dog came into my life. A few years passed and I lost my second dog to cancer. I has absolutely heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. This time I did want another dog because I couldn't stand the loneliness. My family said no. Another few years had passed since and I was now out on my own, living with my partner. I had tried to convince him to get a dog for a long while. He agreed, but finances made it a long process as dogs are quite expensive in my country. We tried adopting, but was not chosen multiple times because we do not have a backyard. 

Finally, an ad was posted. The price was right and it was not too far from where we lived. I was filled with a combination of happiness, nerves and anxiety. We reached out to the seller and anxiously waited his response. Hoping that a puppy would still be available to us. He came back to us and said there was still puppies available. In fact there was only one person ahead of us in line to choose a puppy. I was so happy, but still very nervous. Thinking that something would happen or would go wrong as I had waited for this for so long. 

The day came when we would go and reserve our puppy. My boyfriend and I took the drive. The navigation in the car took us down a wrong path and we almost got completely stuck on a rocky old country road made for tractors that went through a field. I was thinking that that was it, I know something would go wrong to make us lose the puppy. But we managed to get off the rocky road by me walking ahead of the car pointing out big rocks to try and avoid so it wouldn't scrape up the underneeth of the car. 

We made it to pick out our puppy. We had decided we wanted a boy dog as that was what I had had previously and knew how to take care of. Once there the one person a head of us to pick out a puppy was there so we were waiting in the garden until they were done. The seller had misunderstood us or confused us with someone elses preference, so he handed us two puppy girls to get acquainted with while the seller finished wrinting the contract with the one ahead of us. The puppy my boyfriend got handed fell asleep in his arms straight away. The puppy I got handed was a playful little one that was biting the strings on my hoodie. 

We later got to meet the rest of the puppies and also got to hold some of the boy puppies as that was what we initially thought we wanted. The seller asked if we wanted to se how some of the puppies interacted with the bigger dogs outside of their pen and we said yes. The bigger dogs was the mom, sister and aunt of the puppies. We decided to see how the two girl puppies we were first handed and how one of the boys acted around the big dogs. The boy puppy wandered off to explore some sticks. The girl puppy I first held that liked my hoodie went off to be with her mom and the puppy that fell asleep in my boyfriends arms came straight up to my feet to sniff around. It felt like she picked us. My boyfriend felt exactly the same and not many words were exchanged before we decided that she was the one. We just felt in that moment that it was right, where as before that it was extremly hard to choose. All puppies are lovely after all. 

It's been nine months now and I don't regret one moment that she is the one we picked.

66405823dc86a58923286e17;A job interview for your dream job;Truthful;0;"It was a cold Wednesday morning when I prepared for an interview at an institution offering my dream job.

I got dresses for the day ahead and requested an Uber in order for me to travel to the venue. I arrived at the venue late as I had struggled to locate the institution. I was unable to go the day before because I did not have the budget for that activity, oh how costly that was for me!

I arrived at the venue and was promptly called in for the interview. I was a nervous wreck because the boardroom was filled with a very large panel and I was just one candidate. The Chief Panelist was rather short with me and only offered three minutes for each question answered. 

The number of eyes looking back at me was nerve wrecking as I gave my answer to each question. The questions that were asked were not challenging at all as I did have previous working experience that was aligned with the questions that were asked, as well as the schooling experience I had received was compatible with what was asked of me.

I deduced from that interview that I would be appointed as I was able to offer the answers that were in my line of experience as it relates to the interview too.

When I walked back to my transport, I shared with my driver just how the interview went and I recalled all the career decisions that prepared me for that interview. I was so convinced that this job would be the pinnacle of my career and the highlight of my career.

I arrived at home from the interview and shared with my relatives the details of the interview. They asked about the questions that were asked and I how I felt about the interview.

I later went on to call my friend and shared the experience with  him and told him about the questions that were asked. I expressed to him that I hoped to be shortlisted for the job.

660c66c664e1b8cf2bb25749;None of them;Truthful;0;There was a ParkForest called the Forest of The Holy Well, on the other side of the Tardi Forest, which is one of the greatest forest in my county at north. Despite trying to make a trip there with friends, our schedules were not in synchron so we did not manage to do it. I was just building up from my injury and I was thinking the bike trip would be good to regain some fitness. So I made a route plan, and marked a few things to visit, including to very old tree. The weather was good, early autumn weather, not too cold, not too hot, and still a long day from dawn till dusk. Although I overestimated my fitness, and underestimated the difficulty of the road's elevations. Usually, this big forests here are here, because the terrain and geography is not suitable for agriculture. The hills are steep, the ups and downs change sudden. After I climbed too big hills, I took a rest on the bike by let myself rolling. I took legstretching rest at a clearence, which had one of the old trees in its middle, and at its edge there is a statue called the Spirit of The Forest in memorial of former foresters. From there, there was still quite a road till the village at the other end of the forest. It went mostly down hill, in beautiful scenery. The village was longer than I expected though. I managed to find the Park forest, which was at the very end of the village. At the sign, which marked the entrance of the Park Forest, I approached by two kittens. As it was common I was thinking they are wandered from a nearby house. Anyway, I kept going, to hit the trail of the Parkforest. It was smaller than I expected, although It was not less beautiful. The creek which the trail followed, cut such  a nice canyon into the rolling hills, creating an interesting atmoshpere with the sun's illumination from the old tree's crown. At the end of trail, there was an open air church place with benches, looking towards an altar. Next to it, there were stairs led to the fountain the so called Holy-Well. Here, I took my time, to eat, and recover, meanwhile the cats playing around me. One of them even sit in my lap. I was started to think that might they are stray, and as much as I was thinking I could not took them home. I did not have the right equipment to safely transport them, neither the physical shape to safely escort them. Not to mention they would have been in constant danger as I have three dogs at home. Although as I took a short replanning as I've found a much harder, but a shorter way which, was too overgrown, that I could not use my bike anyway, so I was thinking if they are continuing follow me, just as they did I give them a chance, But instead, they did not leave the area of the parkforest, despite their dissappointed, pain and sorrowful cry, as they felt abandoned. I still remember it. The shortcut road at the end, turnt out to be longer. It was much overgrown as I thought, and at some places, I had to reroute as my map did not show the forest's actual stature and its changed.

She was the one person I could actually see a future with. She was very smart, very caring and incredibly beautiful. However, due to long distance, our relationship would be on and off. We had drifted apart and lost touch for some time, until we rekindled in university. But upon rekindling our “friendship” she discovered that she was pregnant with another guy’s child. That truly devastated and hurt me. Solely because I thought I would be her first, and also the realization that she had been with another man during my absence. After learning all of this, we spent some years apart and not keeping in touch. I guess that gave me time to heal and forgive her. Or so I thought. On the eve of my 25th birthday we somehow attended the same work event and upon seeing her, all those feelings I had for her came flooding back. We exchanged numbers and started talking frequently. We then decided to give our relationship another chance. Her kid was all grown up at this point and he was a cute kid. But all he did was make it difficult for me and her to have things we experience together for the first time. I didn’t realize this at the time, but it made me sad to know we will never experience parenthood for the first time together. I would be very reluctant to talk about her son, or even meet the son. Our relationship quickly became emotionally abusive because our fights would somehow go back to past events. And during one of our fights, she broke down and cried.

A very exciting moment in our lives, though things between us have been rocky and we have been breaking up a lot during  the 10 years and seeing other people. I was finally sure that he was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and I was done with the on and off that was constantly happening between us.  After a month he decided that he was unsure of the paternity of my pregnancy since we were not dating for a while but coming together for hook ups in between trying to date other people. I cried days and night  not knowing how he could accuse me of such even though we were not together he was the only one I was with without protection and most times DURING OUR BREAK UP i would remain single .After days of stressing, crying , I then shared with my mother and elder sister the devastating news of him denying the pregnancy as his, They then calmed me down  and they made me realize that I did nothing wrong but was guilty of sleeping with him even when we had issues. I spent the whole of my pregnancy alone with no one taking me to appointments and ultimately gave birth alone, we had not spoken ever since I broke the news and would only after I gave birth to provide DNA tests  which then became a reality. Tests came out and they were positive he was the father and now having to shamelessly figure things out and raise the kids as co-parents. We tried but the love we had for each other made it difficult and we ended up fixing things and getting back together.

So, on this particular day I was told to organize an arts and crafts event, from the advertisement poster to the activities, and the decorations. This other teacher was supposed to help me, but he was nowhere to be found. I managed to organize everything. Everything was ready and we were now just waiting for the event.

661542096b905c6b22a4581d;None of them;Truthful;0;"A few years ago, I met someone online who as time went by I became very fond of. She later became my partner but for quite some time, it was only long distance.
Fast forward to January 2023, I finally got the opportunity to travel and meet my love. I had all the required paperwork in form of visa and purchased my ticket for what was excitedly one of my most memorable experiences.
Being from a third world country, I never had the opportunity to travel by plane ever. This was my first. 
On a negative, the excitement led me to almost miss my flight as I was held back by family who were as excited as I was. We had a long time for good byes and set off for the journey to the airport quite late, understandably so.
So I get to the airport and it was last call. I had no clue what that meant for a fact. I blindly joined a queue only to be told by the people I meant at the check-in desk that they were in fact waiting for me, and that if I was later than that for just five minutes I'd find them long gone.
 Anyway, I was allowed to check in and finally boarded my flight. I was in awe at this monster of a vehicle as I climbed up the steps on to the aircraft. I found everybody else had already taken their seats on the plane. Everything about the flight was just astounding, the take off mostly. I had never imagined how such a heavy vehicle travels at lightning speeds to engage the clouds above. 
time went by and we got to our layover airport. More astonishment ensued as I saw even a larger, better organised airport with lots of people swarming and crossing paths- all racing to get to their connecting flights I was told by some random stranger I asked. I quickly followed suite as I already had a near-miss experience and as the saying goes ""once beaten"" I did not want to take any chances. I was among the first people on the queue to board for the connecting flight.
We got to our destination safe and sound. Everything about the journey was indeed memorable from the meal service to the in-flight entertainment and everything in between on both legs of the journey.
On arrival at my destination I cleared the immigration procedures and the person who was giving me directions on how to traverse everything was on the other end, anxiously waiting for me as I could tell. The bliss in her eyes for everything for me and it is a memory I keep to this date.";year ago meet online time go fond later partner time long distance fast forward january 2023 finally get opportunity travel meet love require paperwork form visa purchase ticket excitedly memorable experience world country opportunity travel plane negative excitement lead miss flight hold family excited long time good bye set journey airport late understandably airport clue mean fact blindly join queue tell people mean check desk fact wait later minute find long go allow check finally board flight awe monster vehicle climb step aircraft find everybody take seat plane flight astounding imagine heavy vehicle travel lightning speed engage cloud time go get layover airport astonishment ensue see large well organised airport lot people swarm cross paths- race connect flight tell random stranger ask quickly follow suite near miss experience saying goes beat want chance people queue board connect flight get destination safe sound journey memorable meal service flight entertainment leg journey arrival destination clear immigration procedure person give direction traverse end anxiously wait tell bliss eye memory date;7;0.52;3.85714285714286;3.42857142857143;3.7142857142857144

I felt that I needed change because I had acquired new skills through furthering my studies. I felt that my previous employer was failing to take advantage and fully utilise skillsets and expertise. I tried to motivate for growth internally however, my efforts did not yield any positive results.

When the job opportunity for my dream job presented itself, I grabbed the opportunity with both hands as I felt ready to embark on this new adventure that I have always dreamed of. The interview involved a panel of five members and each had three sets of questions. I recall that I was nervous because I felt that this is the opportunity I had been dreaming of and I did not want to mess it up in any way. During the interview, the interviewers initially noticed that I was a bit nervous and decided to calm me down by firstly asking simple personal questions that allowed me to be myself. I managed to answer all the questions except for the last question, which was difficult however, I attempted to answer the question as I wanted to make sure that I answer all the questions. 

I was soo thrilled and excited when I received the offer letter via email a month later and this was overtly a major turning point for my family and I financially and also career-wise.

6124d4a2a63ff6077f74fac0;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Truthful;0;I broke and shattered my knee in two place two days before we were set to go on holiday for three weeks end December - January. We have been planning this trip for months, as our business closes for three weeks during December and it is school holidays for the kids. Like most accidents, it was unplanned and somewhat of an unnatural occurrence. Our family (myself, my husband, 4-year-old and six-year-old) was playing inside our swimming pool when my husband and I was playing around, and he tripped me in the water, and I fell on what we think might have been a rock. As soon as it happened, I realised something was very wrong, but my husband thought that it was only a minor injury, perhaps that I tore a ligament or had a minor fracture. After exiting the water with the assistance of my husband and mother-in-law, I realised that I could not put any pressure on it. My fears increased when I realised that I was also unable to move my leg in any way or form and severe swelling and pain started. Due to our medical fund, we were only covered at certain hospitals, and had to travel half an hour from home to reach our closest ER for assistance, which was no easy task. Thus, I did not go to the hospital immediately, but only the following morning. We had to also ensure that the said hospital was a good choice and had reputable Doctors to assist us with the matter at hand. Upon arrival at the ER the following morning, I was then examined and went for X-rays and then a CT scan where after the Orthopaedic surgeon came in to give me the bad news. I was booked for emergency trauma surgery the following morning.

616cb6dee8a5f97dcce06142;Ending a long romantic relationship;Truthful;0;How I ended a 9-month relationship due to finding out my boyfriend possibly cheated on me with an ex-colleague. My boyfriend and I had met during one of our friend's destination weddings in which I was a bridesmaid, and he was a groomsman. Prior to this he had sent me a friend request on Facebook to connect, because I had tagged our friend which was getting married in a picture and he immediately saw the post and sent me a friend request. For about 6 or 8 months he never tried to reach out to me via message or interact with me on social media. Moving along to my friend's destination wedding where we would travel together, we were on the same flight, but we weren't sitting close to one another. We eventually met while waiting for our checked-in luggage, he was travelling with a friend at the time. We all drove down to the destination from the airport, and we had such a drive getting to know one another. Moving along we all had a great time at the wedding there was some signs that he had liked me during our weekend stay. When we arrived back from the wedding, he would constantly make an effort to reach out but either sending a text or commenting on my stories. Eventually we were texting back and forth, until he decided to get me flowers for Valentines Day and dropped it off after work that day. We then told each other that we had liked one another and but eventually came to agreement that it wouldn't work out because we are following different religions. The women would have to change her religion in order for the relationship to work that's at least what had been shared with me at the time. We decided we would not pursue anything and remain friends. Kid you not we started chatting again the next day as if nothing had happened and eventually went on our first date and decided we were dating/seeing each other. We spent a lot of time together and went on a lot of fun dates, he got to meet my family but unfortunately didn't take me to meet his family. My family would constantly ask about the relationship because they knew that women that dated men following that religion wasn't always treated well, therefore they encouraged me that the relationship would not work out. Due to the pressure, I had decided that I would need to end the relationship somehow. Also, when he sent the friend request, I was intrigued but when I met him in the airport I felt as if though he looked younger and somehow as the weekend progressed, I started liking him. We had a mutual connection to girl that we both knew, and I always thought that they girl liked him, and he somehow liked her because she would constantly heart all his pictures on social media and he would constantly talk about her, like a lot. This girl happened to call the one day while we were driving together I think from the mall, he was shocked to see her caller-id on the call but eventually picked up the call. The girl asked about his whereabouts and suggested that he should come visit sometime. He responded and said that he was with me, and the call ended. Because he constantly talking about the girl, I immediately thought that it was not a coincidence that she was calling all of a sudden. I asked him about the call and the nature of their relationship, he mentioned that they hardly speak and that they not in contact. I immediately thought that he was lying about it all because you wouldn't talk about someone unless you also like them and because my family also mentioned that our relationship wouldn't work because of different religions I decided I would end the relationship. I decided to do so while on a coastal group trip and we never spoke for about a month until I reached out because he kept telling people I blocked him on all my social media we eventually spoke and decided to work things out.

60a312b33a3666a9ec786414;Taking the bus/train without the ticket;Truthful;0;I was on a bus going to work at around 08:30 in a busy capital city. I took a different bus, that I usually take, but I seldom buy bus tickets, I try to check people in the bus and at the bus stop, if any of them look like ticket controlers. This time, because I took different bus, I had to change buses one stop before the stop I get out. I lost focus, because I was close to my destination and I was listening to music. When I had recalled the experience, I remeber that there were someone at the bus stop, that looked like the ticket controller, who caught me later, but I am not 100% sure. I should have been more careful. He came to me after 3 minutes in the bus and I was totally unawere, because I was not paying attention to my surroundings (because of the music). I tried to buy online ticket, but he said to me to not bother, that the time would be off, so I did not buy it. It was then I have noticed, that there were actually two controlers - one went from the back and the other one from the front. The one from the back has caught me. The bus arrives to the final stop and they had me pinned. People got out and the bus driver closed the door. They wanted to hand them my ID, but I have heard that you are not obliged to do that and I wanted to test it. They had to call the police to ID me. While we were waiting I have written to my colleagues, that I will be late, because the bus broke down and I have to take another one. Controlers tried to persuade me to look for the ID or to try to pay at the spot, so no ID would be required. I have declined every request, even tough I had the ID at me and I could pay with a credit card. I was trying to work out a plan how to run, but I was sitting at a wrong spot and the doors were closed already. The police has arrived after 20 or so minutes. I remained calm, as I wanted to check if they give the controlers my personal info. I told them the same, that I have forgotten my wallet and my ID and card is in it. They check my identity using my name + date of birth., but I have told them to not to share it with the controllers. They agreed, but then told me that the controllers can legally request it, but it can take a week or more. But there was a catch, if I have paid the fine at the spot or in 7 days, it was 80€ after that it was 120€. I have decided to share my details with the controllers, they gave me the fine and I went to work. I was late about 30 minutes, but it was okay. I have paid thefine the same day and was pretty much okay for it, as I was using the public transportation without a ticket much more, than was the price of the fine. I just have to more careful next time. At the end, I would like to tell, that the public transportation should be funded from our taxses or from the increased taxes car owners would pay and that I buy ticket about 50% of times.;bus go work 08:30 busy capital city take different bus usually seldom buy bus ticket try check people bus bus stop look like ticket controler time take different bus change bus stop stop lose focus close destination listen music recall experience remeber bus stop look like ticket controller catch later 100 sure careful come 3 minute bus totally unawere pay attention surrounding music try buy online ticket say bother time buy notice actually controler go catch bus arrive final stop pin people get bus driver close door want hand id hear oblige want test police id wait write colleague late bus break controler try persuade look id try pay spot id require decline request tough id pay credit card try work plan run sit wrong spot door close police arrive 20 minute remain calm want check controler personal info tell forget wallet id card check identity + date birth tell share controller agree tell controller legally request week catch pay fine spot 7 day 80 € 120€. decide share detail controller give fine go work late 30 minute okay pay thefine day pretty okay public transportation ticket price fine careful time end like tell public transportation fund taxses increase taxis car owner pay buy ticket 50 time;9;0.766666666666667;3.44444444444445;2.77777777777778;1.0

I felt that he was pulling away from me, but I still believed in our relationship. When he asked me out to dinner, I really wanted it to be a new beginning, but deep inside I knew he was gonna break up with me instead. And he did; holding my hands sitting across each other by the dinner table, in the middle of a restaurant. He wanted to take me to the one where we met for the first time, but (luckily) we ended up going to a different one. He thought it would be poetic to end it at the same place where it began. I felt betrayed, deeply hurt, not good enough... We didn't have any serious issues, or at least nothing that should end a relationship. I tried my best: gave him space, tried to get to know him really well, understand him and his feelings, give him what he wanted, make him happy. That was all I wanted, because I knew exactly what kind of a partner I wanted, and he was exactly it. Besides being completely unable to commit and build a deep emotional connection with someone... He is a dismissive avoidant, as I learned later. He was perfect in the beginning, the honeymoon phase was like heaven, everything I ever wanted. Then, as our relationship started getting real, he began to pull away, one tiny step at a time. He started finding all these icks about me that bothered him, reasons to break up with me. Even though I know my worth and how precious the love I gave was, he shattered my heart completely and made me believe I'm not enough. It was the biggest thing that happened to me throughout the past two years, because he became such a huge part of my life, I was planning a future with him. Now my life has taken a completely different turn, hopefully for the better. Because I know I deserve better, and should not center a romantic relationship in my life so much.

60da1362fe5b7aee2580c5a7;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Truthful;0;As a fifth year medical student I am no stranger to the demanding and tiring nature of medical education. Despite my best intentions, last year I experienced a significant setback when I missed an important assignment deadline. This incident not only highlighted the adverse effects procrastination has on me but also served as a crucial learning experience that reshaped my approach to time management and responsibility. The assignment in question was an important part of my coursework, designed to assess my understanding and application of key medical concepts. Initially, I felt confident about completing it on time. However, as the deadline approached, I found myself reportedly postponing the work. Each day, I rationalized that there was still enough time left, and the other tasks seemed to take priority. This pattern of procrastination continued until the night before the deadline, when I realised the panic in me starting to rise and that the task was far more extensive that I thought. Several factors contributed to my procrastination. Firstly, a lack of clear of clear prioritization played a big role. In the whirlwind of clinical rotations, lectures and other assignments, it's easy to lose track of which tasks were most urgent. Secondly, an underestimation of the time required to complete the assignment led to false sense of security. I misjudged the complexity of the project and the amount of research and effort it would entail. lastly, personal distractions and a tendency to overcommit to other activities further diverted my focus. The immediate consequence of missing the deadline was a significant deduction in my grade for the course. Beyond the academic penalty, the experience was a wake up call regarding the importance of effective time management and discipline. Missing the deadline triggered a period of self-reflection and prompted me to seek strategies to avoid repeating the same mistake twice. In response, I implemented several changes. I began using a detailed planner to map out my tasks and deadlines breaking down larger assignments into smaller parts with specific goals. This helped me stay on track and avoid last minute rushing. Additionally I adopted techniques to help me minimise distractions such as designated study times and environments and set clear boundaries. In the end missing that assignment was a pivotal point in my academic journey. It showed me the importance and need to be proactive in planning and time management. The lesson learnt will improve my academic journey for the better and always.;fifth year medical student stranger demanding tiring nature medical education despite good intention year experience significant setback miss important assignment deadline incident highlight adverse effect procrastination serve crucial learning experience reshape approach time management responsibility assignment question important coursework design assess understanding application key medical concept initially feel confident complete time deadline approach find reportedly postpone work day rationalize time leave task priority pattern procrastination continue night deadline realise panic start rise task far extensive think factor contribute procrastination firstly lack clear clear prioritization play big role whirlwind clinical rotation lecture assignment easy lose track task urgent secondly underestimation time require complete assignment lead false sense security misjudge complexity project research effort entail lastly personal distraction tendency overcommit activity divert focus immediate consequence miss deadline significant deduction grade course academic penalty experience wake importance effective time management discipline miss deadline trigger period self reflection prompt seek strategy avoid repeat mistake twice response implement change begin detailed planner map task deadline break large assignment small part specific goal help stay track avoid minute rushing additionally adopt technique help minimise distraction designate study time environment set clear boundary end miss assignment pivotal point academic journey show importance need proactive planning time management lesson learn improve academic journey well;8;0.41042345276873;4.125;2.625;1.75

I was dating this girl called Zesipho for 1 year and 7 months. At that the time of the event i was at home in my village and she also was at her home in another village. Early that day she had went to church with her younger sister and brother at least that is what she had told me. late in the day i tried calling her about twice but she didn't answer the phone but i didn't really put that in my mind as i thought mybe she was busy with something at home or probably was tired since  she was from church and was thus probably sleeping.

I have a friend who leaves in the same village as my then girlfriend his name is makhoba. Around 7pm that evening a received a phone call from him telling me that he had something very important to say. he further say it was about my girlfriend and was very bad. He then told me that he saw my girlfriend on her way home from church kissing another guy near by some trees. He the proceeded to show me some pictures he took of them kissing each other.

661624e5595c233a68a3963b;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Truthful;0;"The truth is almost identical to the previous statement, the only lie was the part of how I started the task immediately. The truth is that because the task seemed pretty simple and because I knew it wasn't my fault for the short deadline, I was also working on something else at the time at work, so I wanted to finish my previous task before getting on that one, even though I knew it was pretty urgent. I also knew I'd be getting extra help from someone else, so I imagined that we could finish it all pretty quickly together.

Unfortunately, as the other person was inexperienced, they were very slow, and as mentioned in the story, I also had to later correct their mistakes. I showed them the basics of powerpoint and how to use it, but they made certain mistakes that I didn't foresee.

Therefore, I believe it was only partly my fault that we missed the initial deadline, aside from that, I was working on it full time and trying to work fast as well, to get it done as quickly as possible.

The reason it was memorable was because I remember trying to work on it as quickly as possible for several days, the frustration I felt with the inexperienced colleague, but especially the frustration and anger I felt with the professor, who later put the blame on me about missing details on the final deliverable even though I believe it was his fault for forgetting about it and giving us such a short timeline to complete it. He can also be quite crude and rude with his students or employees.

This is the truthful version with the one fabrication/lie taken out:
I was given a specific task at work by a consultant of our company who is also a university professor. It was a pretty menial task, transfer the information from some old slides to a Word document, which would be used as an e-book guide for employees, and then create some new, clean, slideshows with the updated info. This was a job done in favor of another company. A certain percentage of the task had already been done by someone else previously, around the holidays, specifically Christmas time, but the professor had forgotten about it, and therefore, when the task was given to me, he assumed 2-3 days would be enough to complete it as the deadline to submit it to the other organization was during those days.
Unfortunately, his calculation was off, even though the task was pretty simple, recreating some of the visuals and making sure everything looked right and clean was more time consuming than he initially thought. I even had a second person come on board to help out, and we still ended up needing 2-3 extra days to complete it all as the e-book was pretty big. Aside from that, as the other person was completely inexperienced using the office suite and it was the first time they were using it, I had to often correct their mistakes, which meant extra work for myself in the end. I was even blamed by the professor for missing some details, and he said I should have been more attentive as this would be the final deliverable, even though he initially gave us such a short time frame to complete it all but still expected perfection, he also wasn't aware of the extra mistakes I had to correct thanks to the other person.";truth identical previous statement lie start task immediately truth task pretty simple know fault short deadline work time work want finish previous task get know pretty urgent know get extra help imagine finish pretty quickly unfortunately person inexperienced slow mention story later correct mistake show basic powerpoint use certain mistake foresee believe partly fault miss initial deadline aside work time try work fast quickly possible reason memorable remember try work quickly possible day frustration feel inexperienced colleague especially frustration anger feel professor later blame miss detail final deliverable believe fault forget give short timeline complete crude rude student employee truthful version fabrication lie take give specific task work consultant company university professor pretty menial task transfer information old slide word document e book guide employee create new clean slideshow update info job favor company certain percentage task previously holiday specifically christmas time professor forget task give assume 2 3 day complete deadline submit organization day unfortunately calculation task pretty simple recreate visual make sure look right clean time consume initially think second person come board help end need 2 3 extra day complete e book pretty big aside person completely inexperienced office suite time correct mistake mean extra work end blame professor miss detail say attentive final deliverable initially give short time frame complete expect perfection aware extra mistake correct thank person;1;0.0196078431372549;3.0;3.0;1.0

The event was split into different sections or components, in order to make it easy to execute and manage. We got to the country and prepared for the event; with all our guests arriving, with no issues from customers, which was a relief as we usually have to go through a lengthy back and forth when organising out of country events. The 3 day event went well, there were some technical glitches, but overall a good event. 

On the last day of the 3 day programme, my superior asked me to put together the visual and audio components required for the ""last minute event"" or ""last hurrah"". In that moment, I felt disrespected as there had been meetings about this last hurrah and I was not invited to either of them, but was now being dragged into the process without any background or context on that segment of the 3 day festivities. With the audio and visual components making up only a small part of the event, i did what I was asked so the event can go on, as we had flown guests from around the continent.

I excused myself from the event and subsequently the rest of the night as I was still at the venue sorting out the last minute requests by the time the guests started arriving.

A coulple of stops before my house, 2 revisors entered the train and started asking for the tickets to everyone inside the train. I started sweating immediately hoping that the train would stop so i could get out in the next station before they got to me. Unfortunately they came up and asked for the ticket. I told them that i had lost my wallet in that night out but that i was a student (since i look younger than i am o was hoping that they would believe that i had the free monthly pass and would let it go).

I tried to talk him out of it by saying that I forgive him and that we could work things out and he said that he could not do that because he had no time to see me because of work. On that Monday, he had lied to me and said he was at work but when I went out I bumped into him and my heart got even more painful. I then tried to talk to him face to face and to give us another chance to fix things but he blatantly refused. I was crying in front of him but he did not care and just kept telling me that it is best if we end our relationship. He texted me a few days later and told me that just because we broke it did not mean that we could not be friends or had to become enemies now, but I could not be friends with someone that broke my heart the way he did. I cried the whole day questioning why I had to go through something like this and why I did not deserve to be loved accordingly.

6596830f2825d3d95e7d5d6e;Cheating on an exam;Deceptive;1;I had an online exam about Remote Sensing. The teacher uses a software to make it impossible to copy. The application is installed and blocks access to external apps, browsers and chats. We have to have the webcam switched on throughout the exam to ensure that the student is taking the exam himself. It also makes it possible to see weather the student is looking at the computer or elsewhere and issues a warning when it detects risk of cheating. This software also records the sound so that you can see if there is any external help. This is a very complicated subject with a lot of material and the exam is only 20 minutes long. In addition, the exam has 40 multiple-choice questions. Analyzing the available time, you can only spend 30 seconds on each question, with very little time to read and think calmly. This creates a lot of stress, even if the questions are easy. Every year many students fail the exam. This year, the teacher gave a set of questions that could appear in the final exam. Over the course of a week, I did these questions over and over again until i memorized all the answers. When I started the exam, I was very nervous because you can't get outside help or consult books or summaries. What's more, there's a lot of pressure when using the anti-fraud app because if feels like someone is always watching your behavior and keeping and eye on you. When I took the exam, it was a great relief when I realized that the questions were very similar. All I had to do was read the questions calmly and remember the exercises. The exam went very well and although the questions weren't all the same, I was able to pass with confidence, My classmates who didn't do the exercises got lower marks and some failed the exam.

This course was conducted online and via webinar links on a university student portal.   During the course's modules, I made notes for myself, which I deemed important information.

I used my time sparingly and, with thought, reviewed my combined reviews.  By the time the formative assessment were about to start, I took a moment to prepare myself mentally and took a comfort break.  As the formative assessment had been recorded via an online Google extention app, we were not allowed to interact with other people, speak to other people, or use notes during the assessment, I was confident in myself that I was well prepared for the assessment.

663f6c3c00d480a9ce332aec;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;"I just have to preface this story by saying I and my partner have been dating for around 2 years before we broke up. We were in a long-distance relationship. We started off well, experiencing a honeymoon phase as with new couples do, even though it was online. Perhaps, the reason why we broke up was we ignored the red flags while in that honeymoon phase and decided to face the future with no plans in mind.

Anyways, to start with the incident, my ex-partner had taken a vacation during this time. I did not hear from him in about a week, with him citing that he was with his family and dealing with a therapist, due to his apparent depression. For the record, I do not slight him for having apparent depression (I say apparent since I am not sure it was diagnosed, but his therapist was pointing to that reasoning). During this week period, I was having an interview with one of my dream universities for my bachelor's degree. It went quite well, and I tried chatting him many times to explain my anxiety, but he just was not answering.

I was quite pissed off at this point (Sorry for my language, maybe I am ranting about the situation now) and I tried calling him. When he finally messaged me back, I knew immediately from the tone of his texts and the following call after that he was attempting to break up with me. He told me that he wants to find someone else near him, and he wants to start focusing on his future. I went a bit mad. I didn't call him names, nor did I insult him. What I did do was say all my feelings of regret, of being with him for the last 2 years. It felt like such a waste to be with him, because I thought he was committed. I just wanted to cry and hurl, but I couldn't even do that because I felt nothing and everything all at once.

After that, I blocked him on all social media platforms and told him never to chat me again. Now, I am thriving as a bachelor in a new country, studying at one of my dream universities. I still think about him and our situation from time to time, but I am facing this new era without him, head on.

65410a2c2b4782dbdb520075;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;"I had been in this relationship for 4.5 years. She was a friend of my neighbor, and we used to hang out in the same spots. We knew each other and we always looked at one another. My neighbor told me that she was into me and this is how it started. The relationship was great, since we already had some common friends, we clicked and it felt like she was the one. I knew from the beginning she had some issues with her family. Her mother did not work and was just wondering around the neighborhood making friends, and he father was a waiter that was gambling most of the money he made. Bills were not paid, they even got kicked out, I wanted to help but she was very defensive about this topic. After the ""honeymoon"" phase, her mood was changing on the regular. One day she was great, one day she was very toxic and pressuring me, the other day she did not care. I knew that the family situation will affect anyone and it will eventually influence our relationship, as it did. She became extremely toxic, bad behavior, shouting, going through my stuff. I would confront her and then for a week she would disappear and would not care at all. After all these incidents, and talking about it with my friends and family, for the first time, I decided that it was best to break up, since I could not help our relationship and her. It would only get worse. She tried to reach out and get together again and I accepted it for about a week, like a trial phase, but nothing was the same as the beginning and she was the same as before. It was very hard and i never understood why she did not take the hand of help i gave her to escape this swamp she was into. To this day I still do not know, if i was her i would do my best to appreciate someone willing to help, not react like this. Anyway, live moves on and it was a great lesson.

My ears went echoing and my body started feeling cold despite it was only 23 celsius degree. I don't remember much what happened next. My left leg was broken, fortunately not shattered. In our group we had the VP of the company so he was handling the situation. He called the company's HR so they can contacted my family. I think they felt bad about the situation that they decided to keep me after the internship contract ended as a compensation from their side. From the offender's side, from what I heard he only had a slight injury on his head and he was being cooperative. He didn't mean to cause the accident, the road was slippery, as what he said. But it was not excuse that he was clearly speeding and that's what caused the car to lost control and crashed to us. I was not the one directly involved in the claiming but I heard the VP was trying his best to make sure I got an adequate compensation.;july 2023 team offsite trip department work island france 18 people include 14 permanent employee 4 intern intern trip suppose 3 day get cancel day catch car accident arrival decide island bike small peninsula road clear car pass time dinner reservation restaurant mainland 30 minute bike rain heavily departure sure wait stop pour weather clear go path cycling small form line cycle cycle steadily car lose control crash group thing remember stare sky feel numb ear go echo body start feel cold despite 23 celsius degree remember happen left leg break fortunately shatter group vp company handle situation call company hr contact family think feel bad situation decide internship contract end compensation offender hear slight injury head cooperative mean cause accident road slippery say excuse clearly speed cause car lost control crash directly involve claiming hear vp try good sure get adequate compensation;5;0.14207650273224;3.6;3.0;3.2

I recalled a time where a crucial security component essential for an international space mission failed to load just days before the official launch. As I described how my team and I navigated our way to the solution which included a last minute trip to NASA to collaborate with top engineers, I could se from their appreciative nods, that they truly understood the value and resilience I would bring to the company.

This interview did not only confirm my passion for the role but also my desire to  be part of this great company.

6167efaf1a027420f7e6a651;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;It was April 2024, the day which was supposed to be a very happy and memorable day of our lives(that is for me and my family). I was heavily pregnant and due that month. I was supposed to give birth naturally, but due to the carelessness of the nurses I ended up having an emergency C-section. My baby was not lying in the correct position, and although even a blind person could see by the shape of my stomach, the nurses chose to ignore that, all they did was to come around me with the doctors and discuss my belly without any immediate action. 2 days passed while I was still in hospital with contractions for two whole days, all they did was come check how dilated I was and left after checking, mind you --all the time they came to check I was 1cm dilated. Should'nt that have been a que to tell them that something was not okay, I mean for goodness sake, I'm not a proffessional but being in labour that long and not progressing could possibly cause distress to my baby, but I was not attended to. Thanks to one nurse, who saw my situation and moved me to the delivery room, where I was constantly monitored and in the early am's getting to the 3rd day, she came to check hoe far I am and found out that I had 3rd degree meconium.... the risk. I was so frustrated and scrared for the life of my baby. Had they been more attentive, none of that could have happened - and atleast booked me for C-section after they noticed that my baby wasn't in a correct position. Okay, I was booked for emergency C-section and that took long than expected. The treatment after, they weren't considerate that I have a new scar and I'm postpartum, they roughly rolled me to the next bed and that caused the urine pipe to pull out of my bladder. Thinking of that day and the money I spend to receive such treatment, makes me emotional everytime that thought comes to my mind. They weren't even gentle when speaking to patients. And oh,no eduation on how to treat the scar and even the 3 days I spent there after delivery, my scar hasn't been dressed,not even once or even checked.

So, when the class finished, I talked with my professor, I told him what happened. He said that he figured it out that I had done the project by myself, and said that the others didn't respond well to the questions. He decided to give me an even higher mark.

I went to the parking lot to check the cars, after the drivers returned them to me, if they were not damaged, if they were filled with gas,...

I checked the car from the outside, then I sat inside and checked if the mileage matched the log book. When I got out of the car afterwards, I locked it. I definitely remember locking it. Then I continued to the next car.

When I got out of the car, I noticed that the car I was checking before was suddenly not standing in its place. It was just gone. I was very confused. I looked at my hand, I had the car keys in my hand. How could someone drive off with the car when I had the keys in my hand and I remember locking it? How could it just ""disappear"" in such a short time? It took me less than 5 minutes to check the other car, I should have noticed something. I could not understand it, I was really confused. I took my phone out of the pocket to call my boss, the phone rang when I turned around and could not believe my eyes. 

The parking lot is slightly downhill. The car drove off on its own and crashed into two other cars parked in the parking lot. I was shocked.

I called my boss in shock and asked him to come to the parking lot.

My ex-partner and I had been seeing each other for about 4 years and he was set to ask for my hand in marriage in February 2023.

This argument brought to light the growing tensions and unresolved issues between us. It became clear that we had different versions for our future, and despite our deep connection, these differences were irreconcilable. 

Realizing that  continuing the relationship would only lead to further conflicts and unhappiness, I made the difficult decision to end it. This choice, though painful, was necessary to avoid a  future filled with constant disagreements and dissatisfaction.

Sadly, by the time I did, a lot of people had already done the same and the space was getting very limited. So much for beating the crowds I guess.

Nonetheless, I eventually managed to find a good spot to sit down and enjoy the cherry blossoms.

We started off our relationship really great for the first half of the year. Due to my sister falling sick, I had to return home and attend to her for a short period of time (a month or so). The problem is that home was 500km from where I was situated at the time. That's also where Sam was also situated. I had my brother watching out for me just in case something weird was happening. And my suspicions we right! Something was indeed occurring in my absence. She started entertaining another dude. The news had deeply upset me. After calming myself I concluded that the best way to handle the situation was to talk to her when I came back. So that is what I did. After being caught out on her actions, she confessed what was happening while I was away and asked if there was any chance of another chance. After much deliberating, I had forgiven her and decided that it was alright for us to keep moving forward,;event take place long ago month 2023 see sam start relationship great half year sister fall sick return home attend short period time month problem home 500 km situate time sam situate brother watch case weird happen suspicion right occur absence start entertain dude news deeply upset calm conclude good way handle situation talk come catch action confess happen away ask chance chance deliberating forgive decide alright move forward;8;0.0995024875621891;3.625;3.0;2.875

605f28b28e4d87b8d3ebf047;Causing a car accident;Deceptive;1;"Ever since I can remember I have always loved the idea of having my drivers license. About three years ago, when I took my first driving test I was so very much excited with the prospect of having the liberty to drive that the test itself felt life a breeze. Why? Because it was. Not even five minutes and the examiner had to intervene because and my exam completely stoped and I failed my test. I was in such a state of shock that I completely lost my confidence in driving ever since, and have yet to get it back. Nowadays I always drive as carefully as I can and still sweat whenever a minor inconvenience appears. I'm always looking and very afraid to loose focus making the driving itself a never-ending suffering. 
About 10 months ago I felt the need to take a drive after a stressful event happened in my life and didn't think twice before getting in the car. I was about ten minutes into the drive when I reach a roundabout and have to decide the exit I'm going to take. I fixate on the third and wait for the cars in front of me to pass so I can enter next. When I finally see a chance to do so, I quickly shift my gear into 1st and enter the roundabout when suddenly a car comes racing in the roundabout before me and I have to fully step on the breaks right when I am entering the roundabout. What happened after was that the driver behind me, not paying attention to what I was doing and about to enter the roundabout after me, started to drive to enter as well and rear-ended my car at a speed fast enough to bump and cause an accident. We both pulled over, signed the insurance papers and went on with our lives. My car went to the mechanics and is now completely fixed and fine and my fear of driving still remains.";remember love idea have driver license year ago take drive test excited prospect have liberty drive test feel life breeze minute examiner intervene exam completely stop fail test state shock completely lose confidence drive nowadays drive carefully sweat minor inconvenience appear look afraid loose focus make driving end suffering 10 month ago feel need drive stressful event happen life think twice get car minute drive reach roundabout decide exit go fixate wait car pass enter finally chance quickly shift gear 1st enter roundabout suddenly car comes race roundabout fully step break right enter roundabout happen driver pay attention enter roundabout start drive enter rear end car speed fast bump cause accident pull sign insurance paper go life car go mechanic completely fix fine fear drive remain;4;0.0914454277286136;3.75;2.75;1.25

60deef8ac5cb89037125765b;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;"6 months ago I had a terrible incident that costed me milliona of rands, both in hospital bills and also therapy bills because of the amount of distress that I had to go through.  On a Friday, 6th Of September 2022, just after I had suppet with my family we had a break in. Four armed men jumped the fence abd and broke the door and held everyone at gun point. They wanted cash and jewellery. I kept telling them we have nothing and they got irritated shot me on the foot, grabbed the TV and ran. My family called an ambulance in attempt to rush me to hospital and a trip that could have taken them 10 mins, they only arrived after 45 mins and that point I had bled to almost point of death. When they arrived they took forever to examine instead of rushing me to hospital. When we arrived the doctor examined me and said I need to be tushed to theater to save my arm but they didn't rush.. Instead I spent an hour there trying to get my details. After an hour they tell me there aren't enough beds at the theater and that my cover will only pay 10 percent of the costs, mind you i am in pain and agony. 

So I'm screaming please help me i can't breathe and they don't pay attention to me. Finally they took me to theater and did a surgery to remove the bullet, and all of this is being done while i am slightly sedated which means I could feel some of the pain. After  the surgery I barely received care, I had to shout oe crawl to the passage to ask for assistance from a nurse. Even when they were they they didn't even look at me and only gave me cheap meds that didn't numb any pain.

2 days after, I was sick of it and called my health insurance asking to be transferred to a better hospital for better care because even my mental health was deteriorating. The health insurance refused plain to move me and say they have already started processing payments for this hospital and cannot help. I continued to inform them of the negligence in this hospital and how this was impacting me mentally and the lady on the phone whose name i can't remember said they can't help and dropped the phone on me.

For the next week I had to suffer in pain without assistance. I was then told that I need to go for another surgery because they saw something during the scan but my insurance will not be covering the bill. I was told that if I don't do the surgery ASAP i could end up losing mobility. So my family had to struggle to put together this money and then my insurance was not picking up their phone.

Eventually I had the surgery again and all was well but now that I have been discharged I want the insurance to refund me for the trauma that they caused me and my family!

A couple of weeks later a speed ticket arrived at my home, referring to a local in that road I need to take to have classes, however there was no way that could be correct. No complementary images of my car were sent, so I obviously decided to contest it, since it could only be a misunderstood.;approximately 9 month ago drive class usual live guimarães study porto 45 minute drive home university attend road need radar monitor car speed specific point locate completely aware place furthermore drive speed limit 120 km h portugal couple week later speed ticket arrive home refer local road need class way correct complementary image car send obviously decide contest misunderstood;3;0.278571428571429;4.0;4.0;2.6666666666666665
65e1dfda31467fe6148d64fb;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;"It was one of my most hectic weeks that I had gone through in the year of 2023. I was in the middle of writing and studying for my final exams. I had a deadline on the same day as my final stats exam. I spent  the whole week prior to the exam studying vigorously for that exam.

On the evening of my exam, I decided to finish off the work proposal that  I had due for the next day so that I would not be strapped for time to complete it after writing my exam. I finished it and drafted the email late at night, while being extremely sleepy. I thought that I had sent the email and removed at least one obstacle that I had to face the next day. I immediately closed my laptop and got a few hours of sleep before having to go to my exam.

I went and wrote my exam and then went on about my day worry-free. Even when I got the reminder on my phone about the deadline, I was relaxed because I knew I had sent it through.

I only discovered the next day after receiving an email from my supervisor that she never received my proposal. I then realized that the email had just remained in my drafts and was never sent through to her. I re-sent the email and all was well.

It was a normal day like any other where my mom was perfecting her driving skills as she was preparing to take her driving test the next day. So my mom was on the driver's seat and my dad was on the passengers seat meanwhile I sat at the back seat. The road on which my mom was driving was a road with which she was familiar with and it was quite a busy road as well however she had gotten used to it due to the numerous repetitions she had done. As my mom drove on the road, there was a truck in front of us which was going at a slow pace compared to the rest of the cars so it seemed fair for my mom to drive behind it as she didn't want to slow down the cars driving on other lanes.  Everything seemed to be going well until the truck driver abruptly stopped at the traffic lights which were still green. So this caught my mom totally off-guard and the car smashed into the truck. Luckily everything was caught on camera on the dashcam. Because the truck driver actually drove off without even checking what had happened. The car had to be towed away since it was in such bad condition that it couldn't be driven. Afterwards we opened a case against the owner of the truck and after the police ran through the number plate which was caught on the dashcam, it revealed who the owner was. From there on legal procedures took place and in the end he eventually compensated us. The car is back in good condition however not like before as it experiences different problems from time to time. None of these problems used to happen before the accident with the truck.;people involve car accident dad mom i. normal day like mom perfect driving skill prepare drive test day mom driver seat dad passenger seat sit seat road mom drive road familiar busy road get numerous repetition mom drive road truck go slow pace compare rest car fair mom drive want slow car drive lane go truck driver abruptly stop traffic light green catch mom totally guard car smash truck luckily catch camera dashcam truck driver actually drive check happen car tow away bad condition drive open case owner truck police run number plate catch dashcam reveal owner legal procedure take place end eventually compensate car good condition like experience different problem time time problem happen accident truck;5;0.733542319749216;5.0;5.0;5.0

I think after midnight was when I decided I was done and about go to sleep. Next morning, I woke up and got ready to go to the exam. I felt ready, I had no doubt in my mind that this was not gonna go well. If I wasn't preparing for this as long as I was, maybe I would have been nervous but I felt confident in myself. So, the exam started and it was going really good. Yes, there were some questions that I didn't know how to answer, but the rest of them I didn't have problems with.

It sometimes happens that I forget to renew it and I only do it on the first day of the month. The was only one time and I completely forgot to renew it and got on the train on the first day of the month without my pass being valid.
I only realized this when the person checking my pass told me that it wasn't valid. Now, the trains I take are the cheaper ones, and there's no way to pay with credit cards, only with money. I don't usually carry money around as a way of avoiding spending useless money. So I had no alternatives.
The person checking my pass told me that I had to leave the train or I would get fined. The problem is: I needed this train to get to my exam on time, otherwise I would miss it. The expression of stress and worry must have displayed on my face, because the guy looked at me really concerned and asked me if I was feeling okay. Now, I'm not a person to lie usually, but the idea just crossed my mind and it seemed more convincing than just a student missing his exam. 
So, I told him that my sister just had an accident, that the police called me and that I just ran to the station and got on the first train I saw with the right destination. I didn't even think about the ticket.
It's important to note that I was especially stressed and anxious about this exam, and had spent all night studying, so it wasn't hard for me to make my eyes all watery.

The first part of the interview process was to be an online interview with two ladies from the company; one was from recruitment and the other was the managing director. The interview went well however there was little time which I feel hindered my responses. Nevertheless I was afforded the chance to proceed to the next phase of the interview process which was an assessment.
The assessment had a time frame however mine was shorter as part of making up for my below average performance in the first phase. I reached out to some of my previous colleagues and university mates to get some pointers.
I felt I was doing well and ahead of schedule with the assessment, however I encountered some difficulties with data which cased me some delays. I then reached out to the company to request additional time but was told that I had already been given an opportunity and if I did not submit the work on the stipulated time I would not be considered.
I submitted the work but it was not to my satisfaction but I had to do what I was told as a candidate.

Finally, one day we had an argument for a very stupid thing, and at the end we finished talking about all our feelings that we had not shared during that year. I told him that it made me so sad that he was leaving, and that I didn't want the relationship to end. He told me that he had been thinking a lot about this as well and he proposed me to move to Japan with him. It wasn't an esay decision for me, but after talking to my friends, family and work colleagues, I decided this was a very good opportunity for me, as I wanted to step outside the comfort zone and this was the perfect chance.
Three months later, our relationship finished because I really missed my family, friends and my home, and he decided to stay there but I returned to Spain. However, I am happy that at least we tried, even if it didn't work.

Due to a separation from my partner, I had to move out of our home which had to be sold.
We had two dogs and we agreed to keep one each. My partner was able to find somewhere to live, in a different part of the country, which allowed a pet.
I wasn't able to do this. I had very limited options, none of which allowed me to keep my dog. 
I tried so hard to hold on to her. I considered living in the car for a few crazy days. None of my friends could or would have her.
I'm so choked up about it. I miss her more than my partner. She was such a terrific companion and such a good, well behaved girl.
In the end, someone suggested a dog rescue centre with an exemplary record for rehoming animals and rigorous vetting of the new homes. 
Not the same one that she came from which was too far away for me to travel to as I don't drive.
The rescue centre agreed to take her.
A friend gave us a lift on the day we were due to go. I took my dog for a final walk - her favourite route. So heartbreaking to watch her ignorance of what was to come but maybe she knew something was up as she barely left my side.
Handing her over had to be swiftly, avoiding a long goodbye. I signed the paperwork, gave her a last hug and cuddle and turned my back on her to go.

Unfortunately what happened is that the jetlag and the distance were too much and not much effort were made even after attempts of discussion, scheduling activities and calls. It is very unfortunate but it is a part of life. 

Maybe one day our paths might meet again but as it is known sometimes timing isn't good enough. Relationships are hard to manage whether they are love related, friends, family, clients, professionals and so on.

Took my phone to watch videos and check on him. He never responded but his status said he was online. I kept sending text messages until I told him I was back. He thought it was a joke and wanted to come to my room to verify. He knocked on my door with some friends accompanying him. I opened and there he was with a blue eye. Apparently he fell on the stairs at the beach after drinking. I never believed that so I didn't show any emotions abd pretended I understand him. I could have dealt with him there and then but I thought of his friends. We argued at night when he came back to see me.

6082c924dd13d8ec285f751f;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;"Last year I studied abroad for 10 months and by then I had never had before a relationship. Everyone told me I shouldn't fall in love while being abroad because long distance relationships are very hard but I wasn't worried at all because I thought ""I hadn't had a date in 20 years, that won't change in here"". I was wrong.
I met a person in my last semester abroad and we got pretty close very quickly: we started dating, held hands, kissed, etc. And I was super happy since I had never experiences what love was until that moment. The problem is that the semester eventually ended and we had to come back to our countries.
We live in countries that are next to each other actually and even if I had always thought I wasn't made for a long distance relationship I wanted to try just for this person. We dated for 3 months in person and 3 months in long distance but I simply couldn't take it anymore. Not because I stopped loving them but because of the opposite. Things were getting too hard for me and I decided that the best for me was to finish the relationship because I was suffering too much by not seeing them at least once every month or so. Meeting is harder than both of us expected and I felt I was wasting their time and mine. I finished things and I think that was the best.
Nowadays I barely think about it but sometimes when someone asks or I meet someone new and we talk about our love life an indescribable feeling comes to my chest. I don't regret my decission, I do know it was the best for me because I couldn't handle the situation anymore but what would have happened if we lived in the same place? Would we still be together? 
Since it was my first relationship ever I find it normal to feel like this eventually but also a small part of me wonders if I ever moved on and if I ever will move on from this unique story that probably will never happen again to me...";year study abroad 10 month relationship tell fall love abroad long distance relationship hard worried think date 20 year will change wrong meet person semester abroad get pretty close quickly start date hold hand kiss etc super happy experience love moment problem semester eventually end come country live country actually think long distance relationship want try person date 3 month person 3 month long distance simply anymore stop love opposite thing get hard decide good finish relationship suffer see month meeting hard expect feel waste time finish thing think good nowadays barely think ask meet new talk love life indescribable feeling come chest regret decission know good handle situation anymore happen live place relationship find normal feel like eventually small wonder move unique story probably happen;7;0.148247978436658;3.71428571428571;3.57142857142857;5.0

5eb94413a6de9c000af1f187;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;"For the past few years I had a problem related to my genital area. At first I thought it was a minor issue and that it would fix itself but last year I decided to do something. I had to go to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me and recommended circumcision for my problem. We made a plan and booked an appointment for hospitalization and surgery on a hospital. 

The day of the surgery I travelled to the hospital ready to have the surgery. They collected my personal details and told me to wait because my room was not ready for me yet. I had to wait 4 hours in the hospital's waiting room for a planned appointment. Everything was supposed to be planned and ready for me. After they assigned a bed to me I decided that it is okay and I will just forget it as long as I am done with this surgery.

After the surgery I woke up when the anesthesia wore off. As I woke up, I immediately felt a sharp pain on my genitals. I asked the nurse if that was normal and they confirmed that it is okay to hurt. I was in so much pain I was getting dizzy, I was on the verge of passing out. The nurse insisted it was okay and in the end let me go. I had to travel alone while dizzy and in indescribable pain in my most intimate body area.

As days passed and I was taking care of my surgical scars and area, I started to realize that there was an optical problem with my genitals. It looked like something went wrong with the surgery. I asked my doctor to examine me again. During the examination, he was hesitant in the way he was talking to me as if he was trying to hide a mistake that was made during my surgery.

Things wasn't going good for us for the last one year, we were still doing our daily video calls and everything but I think it was just an habit. And I later on felt that she was keep lying to me about some certain things like where she was or what she was doing also she was ghosting me a little bit during the day not answering my texts or answering my calls. I was suspecting if she was having an affair, like someone from the university or maybe from work. Of course asking this on text or call would make things much worse she also had such temper sometimes and was getting offended so so easily. I even saw one our chat screen one day when she was sharing her screen and she had changed my name to just my name, before it was something like love or things with hearts and so on. I asked her like why did you changed it like that and I added like it doesn't have any difference from any of your classmates like this, she told me that I don't know.. This was horrible reaction and made me think that something is really off. Then I asked her if there's someone or anything like that. She said that I don't know again. Because for some time she was acting cold, I also got cold and because we can't see each other in real life just as we wanted, we can't have physical contact and so on. That's probably why I also got cold and gave up on trying my best for her. After that we had a talk and ended the relationship. She cheated on me.

They urged an immediate radical procedure. I got an admission date at a day Clinic in Bloemfontein and was instructed not to eat or drink anything after midnight. I arrived at the clinic at 6am, feeling a knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. After changing into a hospital gown that felt like sandpaper against my skin, I was left in a cold, dimly lit room, waiting for hours before anyone acknowledging my presence. Finally, after 8 hours of waiting because the doctor was ""behind schedule"", they wheeled my bed into a stark operating room where the lights were blindingly bright. The anesthesiologist seemed rushed and distracted, and as they administered the anesthesia, i felt a sharp, unexpected pain, unlike anything I'd been warned about.

When i woke up, i was immediately overcome with a crushing headache and intense nausea. My throat was raw from the breathing tube, my mouth felt like it was filled with cotton. The nurses seemed indifferent to my discomfort, taking their time to respond to my calls for help. The doctor finally arrived, looking exhausted and harried, and quickly told me the surgery was ""successful"" before rushing off without answering my questions. In the following days, i experienced severe abdominal pain and dizziness, far worse than i had anticipated. the surgical site became horribly swollen and discolored, and i developed a high fever that no one seemed concerned about. the recovery was brutal, with constant fatigue and a persistent feeling of weakness  that made simple tasks impossible.

655e4ebdb9c29550a157e303;Taking the bus/train without the ticket;Deceptive;1;"Last time I took a bus without a ticket was around January of this year, just before my second semester at college started. It was kind of a one-time occurrence for that period as the last time I had done it with more recurrence was last year. I also had a method to save myself in case the inspectors got on: that is, being already on the screen of the ticket app to buy it instantly and also having ready the date and time settings of my cellphone to change it back a couple of minutes. That time, I did not do that, and obviously, that was the unfortunate time the ticket inspectors got on the bus. It's plural because here where I live you will never see a lone ticket inspector controlling everyone's ticket, they always are in group and there is no chance of escaping. So, that day, as soon as they got to me, I said right off that I did not have a ticket and that I got on the ride just one stop earlier, and I would be off by the next one since it would have been the stop at the train station and I had a train to catch that would have gotten me to the city where my girlfriend lives. I begged them to close an eye for this time since I always had a ticket with me and this happened the one time where I had a kind of emergency since I was already late and risked to miss my train. One of them also went to ask the driver if I really did get on the bus at the earlier stop, and to my surprise, the driver confirmed what I told them. 
At this point, we were approaching my stop, and me, holding a suitcase, had to absolutely get off. I think one of them was leaning towards letting me go, but there was no way of swaying them, and at the end, while I was able to get off at the right bus stop, I was fined 40 euros.";time take bus ticket january year second semester college start kind time occurrence period time recurrence year method save case inspector get screen ticket app buy instantly have ready date time setting cellphone change couple minute time obviously unfortunate time ticket inspector get bus plural live lone ticket inspector control ticket group chance escaping day soon get say right ticket get ride stop early stop train station train catch get city girlfriend live beg close eye time ticket happen time kind emergency late risk miss train go ask driver bus early stop surprise driver confirm tell point approach stop hold suitcase absolutely think lean let way sway end able right bus stop fine 40 euro;4;0.124645892351275;4.75;3.75;1.75

The relationship became quite volatile and when I would see him, there was an element of distrust on his part - I think this was attributable to the long distance. On my last visit to see him, he went through my phone and uncovered messages I had received from a former friend/flame. I had dated this guy very briefly during high school and the messages were, in my opinion, strictly platonic and him trying to reach out after not having contacted each other for over 10 years. 

My then-boyfriend was angry that I hadn't disclosed receiving this message to him. I thought it was harmless, however he interpreted it to be a flirtatious exchange.

6074de03363deb52b54eccf4;Being involved in a car accident;Deceptive;1;"The accidente occured about 8 months ago, at around 8:00 pm in the pasteleira neighborhood in Portugal, while I was working as a courier. My girlfriend was sitting next to me in the car. I was driving down a street, heading towards a restaurant to collect an order, when a car in front of me suddenly stopped. The driver was startled by a van that was making as prohibited maneuver, reversing in the distance. Despite the van veing far away, the driver in front of me braked abruptly for no apparent reason. I tried to react quiclky and brake, but the road was extremely slippery due to heavy rain that had started moments before, whice caused my car to slide and collide with the back of the lady's car who had braked hard.
The impact was significant, resulting in considerable damage to my car: both headlights broke, the front bumper was severely dented, the hood was crumpled, and the fender shrank. Additionally, the impact caused a leak in my car's radiator, making it inoperable. The lady's car suffered more damage than initially appeared. the rear bumper was crushed, the trunk was misaligned, and the rear lights were destroyed. The van, however, did not suffer any visible damage.
After the collision, we called the police. The lady claimed that the accident was the fault of the man in the van, as his prohibited maneuver caused her to brake suddenly, When the police arrived, we probided our statements. The officers informed me that the insurance might blame me for the accident, given the circumstances. However, th elady and some witnesses clearly stated that the reckless behavior of the van driver was the true cause of the accident. After the police left, the lady and I went to a nearby gas station to fill out a friendly accident report. Once that was completed, I took my girlfriend home and then went to my house as well.
Reflecting, I realize that despite my efforts to aavoid the collision, the extremely slippery road conditions and the sudden stop by the driver in front were significant factores. The entire experience was stressful, from the initial shock of the collision to dealing with the police and filling out the accident report. It was clear riminder of how unpredictable driving can be and the importance of staying vigilant at all time, even when the actions of other drivers are ynexpected.

608d5c3d033ac9b6f0c7cfa4;None of them;Deceptive;1;Recently I had to participate in my first ECT treatment appointment, which is a treatment that requires to go under general anesthesia. The booking time for the appointment was at 8AM and I remember I was completely nervous, because I only read bad things about this treatment. Normally, the treatment would require me to go accompanied of someone who could pick me up and take care of me at home, but because I didn't have no one, I was warned that most probably I was going to be forced to stay in the hospital ward overnight. While waiting for the appointment, I was sure that I would be allowed to go home once the nurses saw I was completely fine. But after I woke up from the treatment, I saw how the nurses chatted about where to send me, which room it was my room, and so on. Luckily, I was sent to the same hospital's ward, so a nurse came to pick me up and carried my bed gurney to my room. I remember seeing the nurse and thinking she was quite stylish, she had black hair and some bangs, and either some nice necklace or bracelets, I can't remember exactly. Because the hospital is newly constructed, the room looked quite good and neat. It had sliding doors and a lot of buttons and panels to do hospital stuff I didn't know how or why are used for. I had the room for myself and it was very comfortable. Even though everything seemed fine, I was still convinced I could go home if I talked with the nurses and told them I was feeling great. Because of the required fasting for the treatment, I had skipped breakfast, so the nurses brought to me the breakfast stray. I was so surprised to see that the breakfast was actually fancy, nothing like what one is told when hearing about hospital foods. The breakfast was squeezed orange juice, yogurt with granola, a toast with butter and some black tea. I found this funny because the room already looked like a hotel room, and then I had some fancy breakfast too. When they came to pick up the tray I asked the nurse to review if I could go home, but the nurse kind of dismissed me and said I will go home when a doctor sees me. During the day they came to measure my temperature and check on how I was doing. I was too ashamed to ask again if I could go, and also I didn't want to bother the nurses or go out of my room. So I waited for the lunch service. When the nurse came to bring my tray, I didn't even see what it had but asked her again if I could go home, and this time she said she would ask the doctor but that I should eat first. I was already a bit irritated and got even more irritated when I saw that the food was some kind of fish stew. Even though I felt bad because I don't like to leave food aside, specially when it comes from a service or it's offered to me, I tried to gain courage and stopped the nurse again, telling her that I can't eat that since I'm vegetarian, and that I could go home, get better rest with my cat, and eat my food in peace, more rested. She could only nod, didn't say or confirmed that I could go, but she went out of the room and later arrived with the doctor. He asked me what my temperatures had been, how I felt, if I'm feeling nauseous or if I had any side effects from anesthesia, and then finally, agreed that I could go home only if I took a taxi.

There I was, just having a normal conversation with my neighbors.

Their family is usually over for a bbq every other weekend at my girlfriend's house, even though I am at her house every weekend.

So having a chat with the Mother, about a branch manager job, I asked if they maybe have a job available.

She told me that I would need to go through the whole interview process and physical tests.

I did not accept this, as I am unfit and particularly not able to exercise as per a medical diagnosis.

She then told me I only needed to do the interview, with her and the big boss.

I had left the big boss' mouth wide open with my wisdom in the industry.

I was asked to start immediately.

I did not start there, only 3 weeks later I was offered the job offer.

I refused the offer and demanded a pay increase, which they gave.

I started working there, and little did I know, it was not for me.

We both knew he drives way faster than it is allowed. We arrived at IKEA without any complications (no accident) and could still buy the sofa, but later he received a huge fine for speeding, because the automatic traffic checker system spotted his car.

60a50457d02bfc23c02d4717;None of them;Deceptive;1;"3 months ago, I lost the opportunity of getting what I considered my dream job. The job was a work-from-home opportunity that aligned with my goal of becoming a lawyer one day and with what I studied in university. After going through a rigorous application process that had me completing English tests, writing essays, and recording voice notes in the middle of the night, I received a rejection email from the firm informing me that I did not even qualify for an interview. I was shattered. The loss of that opportunity felt like I had lost a part of me (I had a lot riding on the opportunity, particularly with the idea of growing my business).

A little over two months ago, the company I had applied to for my dream job contacted me with an offer to apply for another work-from-home opportunity. The offer to apply did not guarantee that I would get the job, but because I had qualifications that aligned, it was likely that if things went well, I would get it. This was mindblowing to me. The first opportunity would have had me working as an assistant, while this new opportunity would have had me conducting investigations and compiling reports, abiding by criminal law and criminal investigation requirements. I didn't even know that such a job existed online (I didn't know people could investigate exclusively online). With this invitation, I was also invited to an application training to help ensure that my new application met the standards that my previous one didn't. 
Several days after applying, I was invited for an interview (which I aced, thanks to the training I think). I was then invited for a week-long formal training session, and then matched with a firm that needed me. I've been working for this firm for just under a month now. 

I initially thought that the assistant job was my dream job (because I hadn't known that my current job exists), but I have found my actual dream job. It turned out that even though I had initially thought that the world was completely against me (lost my dad and several uncles less than 24 months ago), the universe actually had a better offer brewing. I've never experienced winning at life in any major way (apart from getting my qualification cum laude), but this twist of fate showed me that I could still win, somehow (and it has been the greatest win I could ever even hope or pray for).";3 month ago lose opportunity get consider dream job job work home opportunity align goal lawyer day study university go rigorous application process complete english test write essay record voice note middle night receive rejection email firm inform qualify interview shatter loss opportunity feel like lose lot ride opportunity particularly idea grow business little month ago company apply dream job contact offer apply work home opportunity offer apply guarantee job qualification align likely thing go mindblowe opportunity work assistant new opportunity conduct investigation compile report abide criminal law criminal investigation requirement know job exist online know people investigate exclusively online invitation invite application training help ensure new application meet standard previous day apply invite interview ace thank training think invite week long formal training session match firm need work firm month initially think assistant job dream job know current job exist find actual dream job turn initially think world completely lose dad uncle 24 month ago universe actually well offer brewing experience win life major way apart get qualification cum laude twist fate show win great win hope pray;10;0.469483568075117;4.9;4.1;4.9

Communication between a team of two is forbidden except though the medium of bidding and any unusual bidding must be explained to your opponents. Teams play different hands of cards against differing opponents with whom they are competing to outscore and win the tournament. Teams usually have bidding systems in place in order to communicate their hands to each other and allow their teammates to respond. Towards the end of the tournament , which we were in a very close second place , my partner made a bid which did not suit my hand at all , I responded with a bid which communicated an ambiguous answer. My partner under our system should have chosen one of two alternative bids in response to my bid but choose instead to react to the expression on my face and passed the bid.

After checking in at the reception, I was led to a conference room where I met the interview panel, consisting of the HR manager, the team lead, and a senior developer.

The interview started with the HR manager asking me about my previous experiences. I confidently detailed my role as the project lead on a successful AI-driven marketing company campaign at my last company. I explained how I had coordinated a team of five developers to create an innovative algorithm that increased client engagement by 40% and significantly boosted sales. I mentioned that this project had won an industry award for innovation in AI technology.

Next, the team lead asked about my technical skills. I highlighted my extensive experience with Python, TensorFlow and PyTorch, stressing how I had developed a machine learning model that reduced data processing time by 30% and improved accuracy by 15% for our predictive analytics project. I also shared how I had conducted a series of workshops to train new employees on these technologies, demonstrating my ability to lead and mentor others.

The senior developer inquired about specific challenge I had faced. I described a critical moment when our server went down just before a major product launch. I took charge, diagnosing the issue swiftly and implementing a solution that not only restored functionality but also optimised our system to prevent future downtime. This quick thinking and problem-solving ability impressed the panel.

By the end of the interview, I felt I had effectively conveyed my skills, experiences, and passion for AI development. The panel seemed genuinely interested in my background and appreciative of my accomplishments. I left the room with a sense of accomplishment, optimistic about my chances of securing the job.";arrive office building feel mix excitement nervousness interview techinnovate lead company ai development bee dream job check reception lead conference room meet interview panel consist hr manager team lead senior developer interview start hr manager ask previous experience confidently detail role project lead successful ai drive marketing company campaign company explain coordinate team developer create innovative algorithm increase client engagement 40 significantly boost sale mention project win industry award innovation ai technology team lead ask technical skill highlight extensive experience python tensorflow pytorch stress develop machine learning model reduce datum processing time 30 improved accuracy 15 predictive analytic project share conduct series workshop train new employee technology demonstrate ability lead mentor senior developer inquire specific challenge face describe critical moment server go major product launch take charge diagnose issue swiftly implement solution restore functionality optimise system prevent future downtime quick thinking problem solve ability impress panel end interview feel effectively convey skill experience passion ai development panel genuinely interested background appreciative accomplishment leave room sense accomplishment optimistic chance secure job;13;0.334375;3.23076923076923;2.76923076923077;4.769230769230769

613b45335ef9d60c2f15bb86;None of them;Deceptive;1;Months back, I had a depressive episode. It lasted for about six months and although I had been depressed in my life before, this time around it was worse. I started going to therapy in order to deal with it. The therapy helped me because my therapist seemed to care a lot about me and just having someone to care about me was enough for me I guess. I suffered a lot of things in my past that my therapist pointed that it must be because of that. My father was never in my life and my mom told me that he rejected me. So i grew up with my step dad, and when my step dad and mom separated, we moved back to the village where my mom and my real dad are from. That is where I met my dad a=but my mom would punish me every time I went to see him. In the village we were staying with my grandma, my cousins, and my uncle. My uncle was very abusive and he raped me twice in that year when I moved to the village with my mom. I never told anyone especially my mom because she was always angry at me for seeing my dad. So growing up I was sad and depressed. So my therapist told me that it was because of this and we tried to resolve this issue. At first the therapy was working and great, but when we started going into the deep stuff about my past, I started getting worse. Although my therapist told me that this was a normal thing to happen, I just couldn't deal with it. I started having thoughts of killing myself because i did not see the point of living. I would even plan out how I would die, sometimes while walking by the road i would get thoughts to throw myself in front of a moving car. One night I was very very depressed and I was at my worse and I made up my mind that I am just going to die. I thought I will never get better and even if I do, I am just going to get hurt again because that is how life is so I should just end the pain now. During those days, I had a sex partner that I would have sex so i decided to go sleep with him one last time because I thought maybe it will make me feel better. So I went and we started by four play and all those stuff, but during that, I was getting worse and I decided to stop but he got angry and told me that I have no right to deny him sex since I came on my own. When I refused, he forced himself on me. After this event, I was feeling even worse and i really wanted to just die. I am scared of heights so I could not bring myself to got to the rooftop, so I decided to just go out and throw myself in front of a moving car. The car ran me over and I was badly injured. I did not die. I was taken to the hospital and I was there for a week. My therapist came and visited me and I got to see a psychiatrist at the hospital. I was put on antidepressants. They gave me Bio Citalopram 10 and checked if they worked and they they did not, they were planning on moving me to Bio Citalopram 20. They monitored me for 3 days and since the pills were working they discharged me.;month depressive episode last month depress life time bad start go therapy order deal therapy help therapist care lot have care guess suffer lot thing past therapist point father life mom tell reject grow step dad step dad mom separate move village mom real dad meet dad = mom punish time go village stay grandma cousin uncle uncle abusive rape twice year move village mom tell especially mom angry see dad grow sad depressed therapist tell try resolve issue therapy work great start go deep stuff past start get bad therapist tell normal thing happen deal start have thought kill point living plan die walk road thought throw move car night depressed bad mind go die think well go hurt life end pain day sex partner sex decide sleep time think maybe feel well go start play stuff get bad decide stop get angry tell right deny sex come refuse force event feel bad want die scared height bring got rooftop decide throw move car car run badly injure die take hospital week therapist come visit get psychiatrist hospital antidepressant give bio citalopram 10 check work plan move bio citalopram 20 monitor 3 day pill work discharge;2;0.30327868852459;5.0;4.5;3.0

I was a very frequent patient at different dentists throughout the time, but due to the negligence of the dentists, I have never learned the real problem why my teeth kept decaying even though I was taking good care of it. Unfortunately, around a year ago it came to a point that I didn't have teeth to be able to chew properly, so I had to choose softer foods and start my treatments as well. This situation had me fighting with obesity as well as eating disorders. I was only able to eat soft food, and eat without chewing much, this caused obesity in the long run as well as lacking important nutrients from different foods. Cystic acne started popping on my head and facial area due to imbalanced diet. Around 7 months ago I underwent the operations and received 8 tooth implants, and my dentist was finally able to identify the long going higher pH level issue in my mouth. I am still suffering from obesity and acnes that were the main side-effects.;spend childhood go forth dentist frequent patient different dentist time negligence dentist learn real problem tooth keep decay take good care unfortunately year ago come point tooth able chew properly choose soft food start treatment situation fight obesity eat disorder able eat soft food eat chew cause obesity long run lack important nutrient different food cystic acne start pop head facial area imbalanced diet 7 month ago undergo operation receive 8 tooth implant dentist finally able identify long go high ph level issue mouth suffer obesity acne main effect;1;0.021505376344086;2.0;2.0;1.0

We were together in the good and bad times and there were a lot of them. Recently, she started dating a guy from our hometown, I know him really weel since he dated another friend of ours. That relationship was really messy and he cheated on her. Jessica doesn't know this part, since I only found out some time later. Now, jessica's relation seems perfect, she's really happy and that's all I care about. About 8 months ago she was proposed to. She was so happy and I was happy to see her like that but honestly I don't trust her now fiance and I'm pretty sure she will suffer one day. Their relationship just seems too perfect and something must be off. Then one day, Jessica asks me to be her maid of honor. I felt a rollercoaster of emotions. On one hand, that was all I ever dreamed of as we grew up together, on the other hand I don't agree that they are getting married. I know I would have to spend a lot of money being a maid of honor and knowing the groom like I do, I'm sure the marriage won't last. All the money I'd spend would be worthless. So I rejected, I said I couldn't accept it and Jessica was heartbroken and didn't understand why I'd say no. I explained that it was a money issue but I don't think she bought it. Since that, our friendship fell apart and I don't think it will ever be the same.

657212151ea2dfd675c45010;Getting fired;Deceptive;1;"I work as the head moderator in an NFT project. The project had been on a downturn for a few months now and me and my colleagues were afraid we would get fired. 

We got a meeting scheduled on the 1st of September with all the moderators, the CEO, our community manager Kiki, and Tess another upper management member. 

Anthony was the only one who spoke during the entire meeting and told us what we already expected. The project was not making enough money and because of that most of the team was going to be released.

Anthony was pretty straight forward, explaining that the 2 other founders that were responsible for funding didn´t want to be involved in the project anymore so changes had to be made. He also told us that this was not the end, that the project would continue as some team members would be taking over the project. They still had some money but now they had to be super cautious on how to use it. 

Afterward, the mods, our ex-community manager Poco and Kiki had their own little meeting, I told them I could not go, I was not in the right mind space for it after such devastating news. They all understood. 

When I left the meeting I just went in survival mode. I loved this job and I did not want to lose it. I knew the team still had some money available and they would need someone to take care of at least some of the things, they could not do everything themselves. 

I had a lot of knowledge about the project, had been there since the beginning, and claimed my way up from a moderator to interim community manager at one point. I knew I was one of the more versatile team members that knew how to handle things in a o lot of different departments.

So I quickly messaged Anthony and I proposed to act as a Moderator, Head Moderator, and Community Manager, doing all the community activities, customer support, and taking care of social media while reducing my salary from 3000 a month to 2000 a month. I live in Portugal so 2000 us dollars a month is a fortune basically. 

I told them that in this new era, they needed someone who could do a lot of things, did not complain, and didn´t take a high salary. I was loyal from the start, worked very hard, and was very adaptable. He knew this so he said he would discuss it with the team and gave me the answer later. 

Then I realized. The discord was very slow now, the team would realize they didn´t need me. I was desperate so I hired a bunch of people to create chaos in the Discord, and was able to convince some community members who by this point were very close to me to create some issues so I could remain on the team. 

By my surprise this worked wonderfully. At the same time there was a problem on the website with our token generation which was just the perfect sign to let me stay on the team!

Anthony messaged me saying that they indeed needed help so they offered me a 6 month contract! 

I was so happy I could stay but I felt sad for the others that had to go. 

But I saw an opportunity that nobody else saw, and I´m proud of myself for that.";work head moderator nft project project downturn month colleague afraid fire get meeting schedule 1st september moderator ceo community manager kiki tess upper management member anthony speak entire meeting tell expect project make money team go release anthony pretty straight forward explain 2 founder responsible funding didn´t want involve project anymore change tell end project continue team member take project money super cautious use afterward mod ex community manager poco kiki little meeting tell right mind space devastating news understand leave meeting go survival mode love job want lose know team money available need care thing lot knowledge project beginning claim way moderator interim community manager point know versatile team member know handle thing o lot different department quickly message anthony propose act moderator head moderator community manager community activity customer support take care social medium reduce salary 3000 month 2000 month live portugal 2000 dollar month fortune basically tell new era need lot thing complain didn´t high salary loyal start work hard adaptable know say discuss team give answer later realize discord slow team realize didn´t need desperate hire bunch people create chaos discord able convince community member point close create issue remain team surprise work wonderfully time problem website token generation perfect sign let stay team anthony message say need help offer 6 month contract happy stay feel sad see opportunity see i´m proud;9;0.488773747841105;3.77777777777778;3.44444444444445;3.7777777777777777

I was required to undergo surgery on it where they cut open the back of my knee and removed some muscle that was compressing an artery.

I went home a couple of days later but my recovery was quite bad as the hospital did not prescribe me any painkillers and my leg began to swell up. I thought this was normal first and tried to struggle through it. I ended up falling in my living room several times and injuring myself further before my partner took me to the emergency room again. I was given antibiotics and morphine, and the bandage was taken from my leg. 

Finally, they fit me with a looser bandage, and I returned home to recover.

It was enjoyable but the cooking was problematic. No one wanted to cook for so many people. It resulted in disjointed meal times and lots of washing up. However, one family member decided to do a barbecue for everyone. Whilst there wasn't really enough food to go around (such as burgers and sausages) we were able to club together a few supplies and was able to include a few side dishes to help bulk things out. It was enjoyable and made easier by the fact we used paper plates which were easy to dispose of and made the clean up easier. If we were to do another barbecue we would ensure we bought disposable cutlery too. Towards the end of the weekend people really had had enough of the eating times situation and we booked a large table at the local pub. We had to prebook our food with us being such a large party but it worked well.

The interviewers asked a lot of questions about my current work experience and how I deal with certain situations in a work environment. I felt that their questions needed someone with more experience than I had. I had to lie and put myself in the position of my supervisor and I had to make myself the troublesome employee.

While walking there, I overheard a pair of of Japanese women struggle with comprehending directions on where to go, so I walked over and tried to help. Before this, I had been studying Japanese both at my university and independently close to over 10 years at this point, so I was able to help them out with the directions to the park they intended to visit and we had a pleasant conversation about various topics, such as their reason for visiting, how they were liking it so far, how I learned Japanese and my time at the University of Tokyo and so on.

But it had to be this day, that an inspector would boards my bus. A couple of scenarios ran by my mind but none seemed credible to get me out of the 40$ fine. A woman in front of me begs the inspector not to fine her because she is going to her children and before i hear the rest of her story, the inspector shows up in front of me with his machine, and asks for my ticket. I take a deep breath, I look him at the eyes full of confidence and i say: ""I am running late, i was in a hurry to catch the train (i show him the suitcase i was caring with me), the closest selling point is in 700m and i had no time. Also e-tickets can be bought only from an android device, so ""It is your fault i couldn't get an e-ticket, not mine"" (there is no option besides android for the bus-app and on top of that there are times which the android app doesnt even work as well). I am sure the inspector was fed up because it was certainly not the first time it hears this kind of story and as he replies to inform me that the use of public transport is prohibited without a ticket. I tell him to ""check my name and thus my ticket id"" and see that i buy tickers regularly so I can back up my story(students are allowed to have a card with reduced fee but they have to issue it on a stand with their id and it contains their name, details etc). After back and forth with him, I told him that if he doesnt let me ride the bus i was going to get down on the next stop and continue on foot, as i wouldnt be willing to pay a fine for not having a ticket due to not being able to locate a convenient point of sale, but the next stop, was my stop either way so i wouldnt mind.

I did not experience any nausea or issues related to general anaesthesia and I was taken to my room very shortly after waking up. Due to past medical complications involving post-surgical blood clots the team wanted me to mobilise soon after surgery, but I did not get out of bed until four hours after surgery. I was not prepared for how painful the surgery would and it was difficult to get up by myself. I experienced numbness through my entire right leg after the operation and was not informed this could be a possibility prior to surgery. I also experienced extreme swelling of the abdominal region which so far leaves me looking worse than before surgery, and I was not informed as to the potential extent of this prior to surgery either.

664378567a9fa5bb14cdbdff;None of them;Deceptive;1;"Last summer I met a girl. We've been getting to know each other for many, many months. Chatting everyday and building a close bond all throughout winter together. Come spring, I was basically sure I was in love. Not that it mattered. We were both asexuals, and I saw no reason to escalate things unnecessarily. We were perfectly happy with our situation. However. 
She comes from a very traditional Indian family, while my background is much more liberal in nature. I'd known for a long time she was going back to India for three months in the spring, only, she never told me the actual true reason why. Her parents had set her up with an arranged marriage. 
I don't have the means to intervene here. I'm unemployed, and have been for a long time. I'm the type of person to never ask anything for myself but I will admit that for a person like her, I'll do anything. I'll get on my knees and beg, if that's what it takes. I know that in order to do anything, anything at all, I need to actually physically GET THERE. Her phone is not equipped with an international number and her access to wifi is so sporadic. We've only had the chance to communicate for very brief periods of time since she landed in India. 
I barely know what's going on over there anymore. She's not able to tell me. 
Even if it amounts to nothing, I have to TRY. 
I can't believe this is my life in the year 2024 I thought this stuff was long dead. It feels like I'm living a movie script. Though I expect this to have a much more reality-fitting gut punch of an ending.

We had been there for the weekend and hadn't booked a return ticket as we were unsure exactly when we'd be travelling back. Planning the journey the night before, we discovered rail strikes that day meant that one of the two lines to our destination wasn't running - the slower line that is more affordable wasn't running, and the high speed line that is more expensive was running. 

We checked the ticket prices, and didn't like what we saw. We decided we would likely be able to get away with hopping on the high speed line without a ticket, given the likely chaos on the railway lines. 

We were both a little uneasy the morning of the journey, as the operator is usually very diligent about ticket checks, but did expect the station and train itself to be busy. The gatelines in the station were open, so we breezed through onto the platform without any difficulty. As the train pulled up, we were pleasantly surprised to see busy carriages - no hope of a ticket inspector wading through those! 

Despite the discomfort in a busy carriage, our concern about being caught eased off shortly into the journey. This was cut short when we heard the sound of a member of staff saying 'tickets ready! a little while off. 

When the Inspector reached us, we decided to be honest. We said we hadn't known about the strike, and couldn't afford the fares on the high speed line. The Inspector, thankfully, shrugged and allowed it this time.";take train partner seaside kent london weekend book return ticket unsure exactly travel plan journey night discover rail strike day mean line destination run slow line affordable run high speed line expensive run check ticket price like see decide likely able away hop high speed line ticket give likely chaos railway line little uneasy morning journey operator usually diligent ticket check expect station train busy gateline station open breeze platform difficulty train pull pleasantly surprised busy carriage hope ticket inspector wade despite discomfort busy carriage concern catch ease shortly journey cut short hear sound member staff say ticket ready little inspector reach decide honest say know strike afford fare high speed line inspector thankfully shrug allow time;1;0.210909090909091;2.0;5.0;5.0

He used my weakness to hurt me, talking about my depression, my anxiety, my family problems. I had enough at that point, somehow all the love that kept me with him until that point disappeared, I hated it. He left maybe the day after this, begging me to forgive him, I was done.

I was given this task to do perhaps around mid year. Sam, my colleague, was initially in charge of this job, but my employee found he has a lack of due diligence and was ultimately fired. This meant I now had to do it. The remittance that needed reviewing tracked back a couple years ago, with around 20 adviser/brokers to review. Some had less commission than others. Meaning it wasn't an impossible task. But definitely an awkward one to complete on my own. The only data I had to reference so there were no mistakes was my boss's spreadsheets of any payslips that had been sent out. However in the end it came to my attention there was mistakes on there too. After doing 99% of all of the advisers pots and remittance there was one last employee, that I made it half way through. But this employee had the most mistakes, and by this point my boss is focused on the new employee we have in that she isn't able to focus time on me and asks me to take more initiative with it. I simply run out of time and have other jobs to do & I don't make the deadline by December.

Our teacher is sort of strict and does not really tolerate cheating in our class. But we cheat anyway, because the exams are usually really hard and the materials to learn from are always so long. This exam was about economics. We had all the notes to learn from in our phones anyway as the teacher sends the notes only like that. I usually have this one cheating technique where i cross my legs and put the phone on the lower leg. I did not prepare any cheat sheet as i was also relying a bit on my phone but also on what I remember from hearing her talking. Later we were asked to return the exams. And surprisingly she did not notice me cheating and all. And i did pass. The exam was hard but as I did use my phone I just copied and rewrote the answers to my answer sheet and made it look as if I did not cheat by making some extra mistakes so it would not be obvious.

Despite all that of course I tried to give it my best shot. I struggled to focuse but remembered a few key words and key concepts of my studies and my notes. 

After a few tough questions and exercises I encountered a tough exercise which gave about 20/90 points. It was just theory questions. I noticed a few fellow students who got up during the exam to go to the toilet, many of them probably just googles those questions on the toilet. But I on the other hand just tried to remember and memorize the theory questions that I learned with old exams and I tried to just think logically. A little bit before the end of the exam I did go to the toilet as well, silly because I hat to pee. Someone had left a note with theory questions on the toilet.

6501b2fd4710fb519ef99d49;Taking the bus/train without the ticket;Deceptive;1;"One morning I went to the Florence bus station to travel to the city of Lucca, where I currently work as PhD student. Unfortunately (but not surpisingly), the bus public transport company is notorious for its poor service (frequent delays, canceled rides, crumbling vehicles, ecc.) and is particularly hated by travelers, especially since they have raised fares a lot in few years (from 6€ to 8.10€ for the Florence-Lucca route, for example). Among these inefficiencies, there is in particular the lack of ticket offices (only one in Florence!!) where to buy physical bus tickets. That's why, recently, the local transportation company introduced the possibility of using eletronic tickets, which can be purchased on a 3rd-party App.
But, as expected, the app developed also turns out to be terrible. Bug and glitches make it painful to buy tickets and stamping is often buggy. The app crashes, loses connection often , and has to be restarted every time. Nevertheless, that day I opened my App and, patiently, I selected the ticket (bought in advance to avoid problems) and pressed the ""Validate"" button. Once done, I took my seat and ""enjoyed"" the ride.
When arrived at my destination, upon getting off the bus I checked my phone, and at that moment I realize that the app was still processing the ticket validation request (the spininng icon was still moving).
Hoping it was just a display bug, I restarted the app to find that the ticket had not been validated. 
Honestly, I didn't mind at the time: considering the bad service and the poor use of public funds (and therefore also my money), I walked away, not sorry at all.

If necessary, I can postpone deadlines for the requests I work on.

64fc9dfe75e6c4bb034e5bc9;Being involved in a car accident;Deceptive;1;"Once upon a time, I went out early for groceries during a seemingly normal morning. However, at an intersection, a car rammed into mine from the right, causing it to spin around 360 degrees. I remember my first reaction the moment I realized there was a crash: I screamed in pain, feeling a strong sensation in my back and barely being able to move my neck.

After struggling to exit my car, I contacted my parents and the police while the woman who caused the accident contacted her carer, since she was a foreigner on vacation. The police officer asked me some questions with a very condescending tone, and after that I went with my parents to our insurance broker. We were told that they couldn't do anything because they didn't deal with foreign insurance companies such as the one used by the woman who crashed into my family's car.

We eventually managed to get some settlement for the crash, but it wasn't enough to cover repairs or a new car since ours was old. We didn't get anything for the physical and mental stress because they thought I wasn't in pain and that I came out without a single scratch even though it turned out that I had ruptured some tendons and could barely move for a couple of months.

It's a great opportunity for me to provide or sell items that people need.
After a long research about the market, I decided to take advantage of It. I bought an online course that was based on marketing since I didn't have any knowledge regarding marketing the items that I wanted to sell online. 

after learning marketing I implemented everything that I learned from my mentor and It wasn't as effective as I thought. It wasn't effective at all because I didn't make any sales. The platform where I had put my business required monthly payments which I couldn't afford. This means I had a limited time before they removed It. 

As much as I didn't make any sales, it wasn't the worst part about the whole thing. What was the worst of all was the fact that I didn't have any views on my platform, views I mean people who had to visit my business as in customers who were looking for the items I sell. As I said before about my items being on demand.

It turns out the whole thing was not going according to plan and also extremely confusing. Time was running out for paying my monthly subscription on the platform I had put my business on and I had no capital since I wasn't making any sales from the business. On the last day  I woke up and found my business closed.

64803fe717b0a137be421ae1;Getting a speeding fine;Deceptive;1;It was last year May and I was chasing deadlines at work. As a commission earner, some months are generally slow which put a lot of pressure on me. I had just finished a client meeting which had not gone well. The client decided at the end of the meeting that she did not want to go ahead with the products I offered. On my way back home, I got a call from my wife that our child had fallen very ill and needed to be rushed to the ER. Being understandably stressed and in a hurry, I did not notice the speed I was driving and ended up being pulled over by a traffic officer for going above the speed limit. The officer followed the routine guidelines when pulling me over and advised me that he was going to write me up for speeding. I explained the situation to the traffic officer and pleaded with him to let me go without issuing me a ticket as I was dealing with a family emergency. After a few minutes of consideration, the traffic officer let me go with a warning. I had avoided a huge speeding ticket since I had been traveling much, much higher than the speed limit.;year chase deadline work commission earner month generally slow lot pressure finish client meeting go client decide end meeting want ahead product offer way home get wife child fall ill need rush er understandably stressed hurry notice speed drive end pull traffic officer go speed limit officer follow routine guideline pull advise go write speeding explain situation traffic officer plead let issue ticket deal family emergency minute consideration traffic officer let warning avoid huge speeding ticket travel high speed limit;8;0.3125;4.5;3.75;2.375

When I asked how we would get around she answered that the city has both a Metro and Tram system that would take us to all the major attractions. I researched the topic and came up with the possibility to buy a two day pass over the weekend for 20 eur. I asked her if this would be worth it and she said no, the inspectors never really look at the tickets but she would always buy them anyway. I was inclined to believe her as she had now been here for two months and had used the services many times. After getting on the tram for the third time that day, they indeed came to check our tickets. Since I had believed her previous statement I had not bought one when entering the tram.

As I carefully checked for oncoming traffic, an SUV suddenly sped around the corner and collided with my vehicle. The impact was so forceful that it not only broke my rear fender and muffler but also caused significant damage to the trunk and rear lights. The other driver was clearly at fault for not slowing down in a parking lot area. We exchanged insurance details and filled out the accident report. I also noticed that the collision had misaligned the rear axle of my car, causing it to be unsafe to drive. The tow truck driver who came to assist mentioned that the damage appeared extensive and suggested that it might cost a substantial amount to repair.

5f217f528ba46c08032a1c42;Taking the bus/train without the ticket;Deceptive;1;"This event has happened two weeks ago on sunday when I was coming back from my friends house in which I spent whole weekend with him, his wife and few other friends. He lives in a nearby city and the best way to travel there is by train. It is cheap and usually takes only 30 minutes. On friday morning a bought two-way ticket but I did not realize that on my way back I enterned the wrong train. The train that I entered was from the same railway company and also traveled in the same direction, but it made few more stops along the way on some smaller stations. When the realization hit I panicked a little bit but I thought to myself that I will probably avoid ticket inspector as the train was big and I was in the back of the train when conductor's compartment was on the front. Unfortunetly I was wrong, one of the conductors that inspect the ticket was already in the compartment I was staying in. I tried to stay cool but I was a little stressed out, I just prayed in my head that he will be nice and we will come to some form of agreement.

At first i though it was a joke until i found them in the guy's office. Mr Khubeka was one of the best teachers in our school, he taught physics and math's to our grade 12 learners. I found them in the office kissing. I just stood the speechless, not knowing what to do. I went to our principal's office to report him but he was busy (principal). Mr Khubeka tried to beg me, we went back and forth until he slapped me. Later that day I went to our principal's office to report him, turns out our principal knew about the affair, he is afraid to report him because he might get fired and our learners need him more because they were preparing for exams. I wanted to report them to the department but I couldn't because I did not have any witnesses or anyone on my side. I spoke to the candidate to report him and she said no. They started treating me bad, saying bad things about me, watching my mistakes to get me fired which worked because I got fired three months later. They wrote a letter to the department of education about how lazy I am, how bad I am to the kids, I beat the kids and all that.

60d0da6d77e686a54bb6d3fe;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;"What happened:
We were assigned on an audit for three weeks, which the deadline was tight considering the amount of work that we needed to. at the beginning of the audit i designed a project plan for the team to follow in order to avoid missing the deadline. 
The team and I tried to stick to the project plan and kept the engagement partner and the manager up to date as we were giving daily updates to them.
During the audit there were client delays where we requested information and the information was not given to us on time in order to complete the execution of the audit and we did report these to the manager as they were likely to cause us to miss the deadline. there were times where we were given wrong information that resulted to more delays. 
The budgeted hours on the job were also not enough and when we requested for an overtime to be approved this request was rejected. all these factors combined resulted to us missing the deadline by a week.
As the delays were also communicated with the manager and the team did their best to meet the deadline it was not possible without working overtime and with client delays involved.
When asked to explain why we missed the deadline i did explain all these facts to the manager and the partner. I don't think it would be fair to blame us for missing the deadline and our performance ratings should not be affected by this.
This event took place on the 22 of April 2024 at our offices as we were not working at the client premises.";happen assign audit week deadline tight consider work need beginning audit design project plan team follow order avoid miss deadline team try stick project plan keep engagement partner manager date give daily update audit client delay request information information give time order complete execution audit report manager likely cause miss deadline time give wrong information result delay budget hour job request overtime approve request reject factor combine result miss deadline week delay communicate manager team good meet deadline possible work overtime client delay involve ask explain miss deadline explain fact manager partner think fair blame miss deadline performance rating affect event take place 22 april 2024 office work client premise;7;0.693140794223827;3.85714285714286;3.14285714285714;2.0

63ed0d717ceb58b69ff6ce58;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;"This past year, I went through a really tough time with my health. It started with a tonsillectomy in January, and then an emergency operation to remove my appendix a few months later.

After getting my tonsils out, I experienced severe throat pain that lasted a week. I struggled to eat solid food for a long time, which caused me to lose a lot of weight, become quite weak etc. to make matters worse, I developed an infection at the surgical site, which meant I had to go through multiple rounds of antibiotics and spend a lot of time resting in bed. This really threw a spanner in the works for my work and family life, as I have to juggle work and looking after my two kids. 

Just as I started to feel a bit better, I suddenly had intense abdominal pain and had to rush to the hospital. It turned out to appendicitis, and I needed surgery right away. Unfortunately, this surgery didn't go smoothly either. I had a severe allergic reaction to the anaesthetic, which caused swelling and breathing issues, so I had to stay in ICU for several days. 

To top it off, the incision for this surgery got infected too. I had to take even more antibiotics and undergo another minor surgery to drain the infection. This caused a lot of pain and stress.

All these complications really took a toll on me physically and emotionally, leading to a lot of anxiety and a long recovery period. I had to take a significant amount of time off work, as well pay extra money for childcare as I wasn't able to care for my children, so it took a financial toll as well.";past year go tough time health start tonsillectomy january emergency operation remove appendix month later get tonsil experience severe throat pain last week struggle eat solid food long time cause lose lot weight weak etc matter bad develop infection surgical site mean multiple round antibiotic spend lot time rest bed throw spanner work work family life juggle work look kid start feel bit well suddenly intense abdominal pain rush hospital turn appendicitis need surgery right away unfortunately surgery smoothly severe allergic reaction anaesthetic cause swell breathing issue stay icu day incision surgery get infect antibiotic undergo minor surgery drain infection cause lot pain stress complication take toll physically emotionally lead lot anxiety long recovery period significant time work pay extra money childcare able care child take financial toll;13;0.366782006920415;4.30769230769231;3.76923076923077;4.3076923076923075

We did not want to have a big wedding, just a small one with very close friends and family since we did not have much money. We have been together for 9 years and many of our close friends and family know how much we have been tested yet we stood by each other. On our wedding day, came our local favorite artist to perform for us, i was so surprised and very happy because that was not expected. I wondered how did this happen? Only to find out that it was our parents. It was great to experience such love from our parents and everyone else who came to support.

On top of the absolutely electrifying tennis that day of a too close to call match between the top 2 players, I will never forget the experience for what had taken place towards the end of the match.
As Djokovic kept looking like the one to run out of steam first, I just couldn't help myself to shout strategies to him from the stands, as an involved, overzealous fan would. On a few instances, I noticed him seemingly taking my advice which I just brushed off as a coincidence, since I figured he is already knew better anyways, he is the pro!
To my amazement, as he was signing autographs in the stands after his victory, he made eye-contact with me as I held my large tennis ball out for him to sign, and he smirked at me saying ""that down the line on the backhand side advice came in clutch, thank you"".

5db9af1d515b5e01756f55b8;None of them;Deceptive;1;"It all started the day I had a gynecological check-up to see how the pregnacy was going. The gynecologist cracked my placenta on purpose and never asked my permisssion. She told me that the baby girl was very big and that if it took me another week to go into labor, it would be an ever bigger baby.

Then I had to stay in the hospital because I was leaking amniotic fluid and blood. They couldn't let me go home. Either I would go into labor on my own in a few hours or I would be induced with intravenous artificial oxytocin. It was horrible. Since I wouldn't go into labor, they stared on synthetic intravenous oxytocin and it was very painful.

Since the girl was very big, she didn't come out easily. I was stuck and the midwives wouldn't letme get up. I was forced to lie down and it was very painful and traumatic. They climbed on top of my belly and squeezed with their hands, fists and elbows. They used medieval, obsolete practices, banned by the Wolrd Heath Organization for many years. I was injured.

They injured my abdomen, they gave me severe abdominal diastasi above my navel, right where they squeezed with their elbows. And I also had an umbilical hernia. In addition, they used forceps to get the girl out and they did a very large episiotomy, which has generated many complications for me.

My daughter was born with an open wound on her head, bleeding, with a totally abnormal shape. His forehead and nose were completely purple and she had a bleed eye that lasted two months. I will never forgive them for what they put us through. It could have been done differently. Well, done and respectfully.

6578791f426c682e88eaa391;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;"I woke up early that day, it was a Wednesday. 

I got up, made the bed, brushed my teeth, went to the kitchen and make the school lunch for my kid, then I made breakfast.

Woke up my kid, served breakfast, and then we got ready for school, I got a few miles on the treadmill, then got a shower, dressed and ready. I checked my schedule for the day, all in order, I have to submit the month end time sheets, no big deal, I'll do it after i get my kid to school. I get a few things done from work ahead of time since I have a few minutes before its time to leave. The alarm sounds.

I help my kid get dressed. He protests but I get him to hurry up. We get out on time, drive, and a few houses down I hear it. A distressed scream.

On the backseat, my kid looks at me and says, 'Dad, look"". He points out the window to the sidewalk. Then I see it. It's Chuck, the block's gardener, he is laying on the sidewalk, trying to hold back a scream, he is pressing on his leg, by now we have stopped, he looks at me. I have to stop. 

We park and I ask my kid to remain calm and stay on his booster seat. I will go and see if Chuck is OK, then we'll get to school. 

as I approach him, I can see we are not going to school. Chuck's leg is twisted, he tells me he fell down the tree he was pruning. I offer to get him to the nearest clinic, I help him up and carefully seat him on the passenger's side. We rush to the clinic.

My kid is usually opinionated about things, and he has strong opinions about the things that alter his day to day. He did not say a word, other than 'You are going to be OK Chuck, They're going to fix you at the Hospital' I'm so proud of him.

We get to the clinic and an orderly seats him on a wheelchair, Chuck thanks me and disappears behind the glass doors. I now get back to my senses, the school, my kid, my meeting, I'm late for everything. Somehow I'm not worried, I did the right thing, I made somebody's life a bit less hard, and I did it with my son. There will be some blow back, but it's worth it, We'll figure it out.

I have been applying for remote jobs more than I apply for office jobs. I applied for a remote job at JobDuck, first application i didn't get any response but I didn't lose hope. I applied for the second time and this time I made it to the interview stage. The job application required applicants to submit a cv, essay and voice recording introducing themselves. On the essay we were told to talk about our previous experiences and to choose from a range of packages that we will receive if we were to get the job. After receiving this feedback I started praying very hard. I asked our Heavenly Father to break protocol for me and for his favor to locate me. I did this because I knew that I'm not good with interviews. I would ask the Lord to allow the recruiters to see my potential without going through the interview stage. I remember I even went on a fast and prayed for the same thing everyday. One day I work up to an email informing that I don't have to go through the interview process because the job is already mine and I start training the following week. I was told that my cv, essay and voice recording that I submitted on my application were enough and they believe I am the right candidates for the job. I could not believe that one of my biggest wishes came true and just like that I was employed by JobDuck. I completed my training and I was told that as a gift I get a fully paid for trip to the US. This trip was for leisure and for me to see their offices and from there on I would work remotely.

661fcba2a52176d3a7bdddce;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;About 23 months ago I had to undergo surgery on my kidney, to remove kidney stones, in Mossel Bay. Unfortunately I live a full two hours drive away from the hospital. Even though I had just moved a couple of months before to this small new town, I was so lucky to have met the most amazing new friends. Both my children lived in different cities and obviously I could not do any of this by myself. I was and still is amazed at how quickly small communities come together to help people in need, even if they are new to the community. The day before I went to the hospital, I went to do some shopping and got all the food and snacks I would need for a couple of days, as well as some water. I did not want to be to much of a burden to my new found friends. As it is a two hour drive we left very early at about 4 am in the morning. We got there just on time and was assisted by friendly and helpful admin staff. If it was not for the wonderful hospital staff I don't know what I would have done. Having kidney stones removed is a really painful experience and it did not help that I had a unsympathetic doctor. Fortunately the procedure went well and I could go home the next day. My new friend came all that way to pick me up again and bring me home.  We did take it slow though because I was still in a bit of pain and discomfort. Luckily there was 3 rest stops along the way where we could get out and stretch our legs. So the positive from this experience is that I know who I can ask for help in future and I know that I would rather give birth to my two children, than have kidney stones again.;23 month ago undergo surgery kidney remove kidney stone mossel bay unfortunately live hour drive away hospital move couple month small new town lucky meet amazing new friend child live different city obviously amazed quickly small community come help people need new community day go hospital go shopping get food snack need couple day water want burden new find friend hour drive leave early 4 morning get time assist friendly helpful admin staff wonderful hospital staff know have kidney stone remove painful experience help unsympathetic doctor fortunately procedure go home day new friend come way pick bring home slow bit pain discomfort luckily 3 rest stop way stretch leg positive experience know ask help future know birth child kidney stone;12;0.41358024691358;5.0;5.0;2.9166666666666665

I then see this girl profile picture and she was looking very gorgeous and attractive, so decided to send her a friend request on Facebook and after a few minutes she accepted my friend request. I then message her on Facebook asking where she's from and more about herself. After that, we learned more about each other and where we live. I asked her whatsapp number and we chatted on there. We chatted on WhatsApp and I ask that she must send few pictures of her and she ask pictures of me. We complement each other and started to vibe with each other, We chatted for days and started falling in love with each other. We planned a meet up, because I really wanted to meet her in person. So we decided on a date when we both are available. I wasn't really available because my girlfriend was by me/at my house at the time. So the day we meet up my girlfriend was by me, so I lied to my girlfriend that I must go to a meeting but I wasn't, I was going to meet her in town. I meet up with her in person we talked, and she asked if I was single and I said yes, but meanwhile I'm in a whole relationship with my girlfriend. This girl started to be touchy with me. We kissed and drink 2 beers and chilled. Her company was so nice that I forgot to look at the time, because my girlfriend said I mustn't take long at the meeting because she's at my house alone. So this girl finally goes home and I go to my house. When I camed home my girlfriend was very angry at me because I was taking long to reply to her messages and I was getting home late. So I explained the meeting was long and stuff and she understand. Few days goes by and me and this girl still chatting and flirting with each other. Next day me and my girlfriend was chilling and drinking. I was so drunk that day that I couldn't keep my eyes open. While I was drunk me and this girl started chatting and sending love emojis for each other. So the night before I go to sleep I message the girl a goodnight message, but I couldn't keep my eye's open because I was to drunk. So I falled a sleep with my phone in my hands and my phone was open on the chats with that girl. My girlfriend was still up that moment. When my girlfriend tried to put my phone of and on charge, she see my chats with that girl and started to cry and ask me what is this that I chat with this girl.

We planned to walk around the village, visit the church, which has a historical value, and enjoy the trandtional food. My bag was full with fresh fruits i got from my mum, because we wanted to have a picnic too. That's why i gave some of my personal belongings such as my wallet,keys,and my sunglasses to my friend's bag, which was almost empty.We got to the bus and we waited the driver(who was the ticket's inspector too) to give us the tickets and pay him. The moment my friend tried to find our wallets from her bag, she realized that someone stole them. Propably when we were to the metro earlier, which was crowded,someone robbed her. We got panicked and my friend started crying because it was her fault. We explained to the ticket's inspector what had happened, he believed us and we didn't got a penalty.We were lucky because my brother was at that village, so he waited us to arrive, he paid our tickets and gave us money to enjoy our trip.;6 month ago take bus good friend villge 30 minute away city live sunday morning wake early morning catch bus weather good want spend day village plan walk village visit church historical value enjoy trandtional food bag fresh fruit get mum want picnic give personal belonging wallet key sunglass friend bag get bus wait driver(who ticket inspector ticket pay moment friend try find wallet bag realize steal propably metro early crowd rob get panic friend start cry fault explain ticket inspector happen believe get penalty lucky brother village wait arrive pay ticket give money enjoy trip;7;0.392561983471074;4.85714285714286;3.85714285714286;2.7142857142857144
6649ec78b653af2aea562697;None of them;Deceptive;1;"I've always wanted another dog. I've had two dogs previously. They were my best friends. The were what kept my depression at bay. After my first dog died I didn't want another dog because I couldn't bare with feeling that loss again. I didn't have a choice though, one day he was just there. My family had decided to get another dog without informing me before hand and without considering my feelings about it. I was resentful to a start, but the second dog came to be my new best friend.

After a few years, my second dog dies of cancer. I was once again heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. This time I wanted another dog because I couldn't stand the lonliness. My family decided no. 

Another few years passed and by this time I'm out on my own and living with my boyfriend. I had tried to convince him for a while to get a dog and one day he finally agreed. Finances was the main thing that hindered it though, but he tasked me with trying to find one within our budget and one that was not too far away. It was hard as dogs are very expensive in my country. We also tried to adopt, but our applications were turned dogs multiple time because we didn't have a backyard. 

One day it happened though, I found an ad that was within our budget and not too far away. We contacted the seller and waited axiously for him to reply. He came back to us and told us we could come visit to pick out a dog. 

This is when my nerves got the better of me and all the hurt and sadness hit me like a ton of bricks. Could I really stand the sadness of losing another dog one day? To feel that emptiness of not hearing the little paws running around on the floors? It all just became too much for me and after talking it over with my boyfriend we decided that maybe we should wait a little longer until I've processed everything a bit more. 

I regret not getting that puppy everyday. Now it feels like I've built up such a wall in my mind that it feels impossible to get over. I know how much happiness a puppy would give me, but I don't know if I could survive the grief of losing another one again.";want dog dog previously good friend keep depression bay dog die want dog bare feel loss choice day family decide dog inform hand consider feeling resentful start second dog come new good friend year second dog die cancer heartbroken fall deep depression time want dog stand lonliness family decide year pass time live boyfriend try convince dog day finally agree finance main thing hinder task try find budget far away hard dog expensive country try adopt application turn dog multiple time backyard day happen find ad budget far away contact seller wait axiously reply come tell come visit pick dog nerve get well hurt sadness hit like ton brick stand sadness lose dog day feel emptiness hear little paw run floor talk boyfriend decide maybe wait little long process bit regret get puppy everyday feel like build wall mind feel impossible know happiness puppy know survive grief lose;4;0.258992805755396;3.5;4.75;2.0

I was called into the boardroom and to say I was nervous was an understatement. It did not help that that was my first ever formal interview. The preparatory material I had utilized for this interview were inadequate in comparison to what was asked of me. 

I walked out of the venue feeling perplexed. I hoped that I would receive a call back and I was worried because I did not receive any type of validation from the interviewing panel during the interview.

That interview experience will always be memorable to me because of the type of questions I was asked and the types of questions I was looking out for when preparing for the interview. I walked away hoping for validation and I gave it to myself. I recalled the work experience I had acquired prior to the interview and why I was deserving of the role. I convinced myself that this job was my pinnacle and that my career peak will be realised because of this job.

Without financial help, i had to work many part-time jobs to pay for my tuition and living expenses. This left me very tired and struggling to keep up with my studies.

The department knew about my tough financial situation and decided to give me the top student honors award. They knew this award comes came with a cash prize. The knew the money will help me continue my education and help my mother. The professors saw not just my good grades but also my determination despite my personal and financial problems. Besides my classes , i was involved in research projects focused on helping low-income communities get better healthcare, which is important to me because of my own background. Even with all my efforts, i never got any grants or financial support for my research. making it even harder to manage.

I have 3 kids that I need to to take care of, as a single mother i need to be strong so I can provide the needs of my kids.

660c66c664e1b8cf2bb25749;None of them;Deceptive;1;The Parkforest of the Holy Well, which name marks a spring, is about 50km away. My friends always told me it is worth to see it, but unfortunately due to different schedules we never had the chance to visit it together. So after recovering from an injury, I decided its time to take a bike trip, go across the Tardi Forest, and visit, the Parkforest, and some notable very old tree, marked on the Dendrology Webpage. The trip, first went well. Although de elevations seemed much tougher than I remembered. I enjoyed rolling down on the windy forest road, and even I've found some delicious mushrooms. At the end of the forest road, I take a short rest at a clearance where there was the statue of the Spirit of the Forest, with former Foresters' name on it. This part is one of my favourite part of the Tardi forest, as it is the oldest, with mighty Oaks which cover a scenic geography. After I finished my rest, I continued my way to a village. The road was slightly downhill from there so I just let myself roll and enjoy the scenery. The village was different though. It was much longer than it appeared on the map, and by the time I arrived to the Parkforest, I felt pretty tired. At the very end of the village, was the parkforest. I took off from my bike, and checked the sign, when suddenly two little kitten appeared around my leg. They seemed well fed, and healthy. So I was thinking they might be came from a house nearby. I pet them, then I hit the trail which marked with a Szekler Gate. For my surprise the cats followed me. The parkforest, despite small, was really worth the visit. The trail followed the canyon of a small creek, creating weird but beautiful geoshapes, meanwhile from the crowns of the trees, the sun light leaked, sometimes breakthrough giving an otherworldy illumination. And at the end of the track, there was an open church with benches and an altar, a Holy Mary statue, and the Holy Well itself. A stair led to the spring which was built around with stones. The cats were still around me, and one even laid down my lap after I wondered enough in the place and took a rest with snacks. Meanwhile I measured my physical status, my supplies in regard of planning the way back, my hunch grew stronger that the cats might be straight and it would might be better if I took them home. For me it was quite the struggle. First, I had to make a makeshift carrier to my carrier rack, where they feel good enough, and consider, I have to push my bike all way back home as I can't ride speedy with two cats, Eventually, I checked the map, and took a short cut trail, although it was in a terrible condition. And I managed to call a car as soon as I arrived to the other side of the forest into a village. After I went home, it was hard for my three dogs to befriend the cats, even until we didn,t find them a better place. For me, it was an exhaustive day, which gave me a better glimpse, riding in the forest, find new roads, and how to prepare with supplies.;parkforest holy mark spring 50 km away friend tell worth unfortunately different schedule chance visit recover injury decide time bike trip tardi forest visit parkforest notable old tree mark dendrology webpage trip go de elevation tough remember enjoy roll windy forest road find delicious mushroom end forest road short rest clearance statue spirit forest foresters favourite tardi forest old mighty oak cover scenic geography finish rest continue way village road slightly downhill let roll enjoy scenery village different long appear map time arrive parkforest feel pretty tired end village parkforest take bike check sign suddenly little kitten appear leg fed healthy think come house nearby pet hit trail mark szekler gate surprise cat follow parkforest despite small worth visit trail follow canyon small creek create weird beautiful geoshape crown tree sun light leak breakthrough give otherworldy illumination end track open church bench altar holy mary statue holy stair lead spring build stone cat lay lap wonder place take rest snack measure physical status supply regard plan way hunch grow strong cat straight well take home struggle makeshift carrier carrier rack feel good consider push bike way home ride speedy cat eventually check map take short cut trail terrible condition manage car soon arrive forest village go home hard dog befriend cat didn t find well place exhaustive day give well glimpse ride forest find new road prepare supply;6;0.143109540636042;3.83333333333333;3.33333333333333;3.8333333333333335

I went to sleep early and woke up at 5:00am in the morning, washed my face, brushed my teeth got everything ready for the trip and left. I couldn’t take a shower as I was going to be late so I decided I would take a shower at the hotel I will be at when I get to Cape Town. I got there at the bus station just in time for me to properly put my luggage in and get the seat I wanted to get. We departed at 6:00am and 1 hour in the trip I fell asleep for about a few hours. The trip had multiple stops as people wanted to get food and need the restrooms but I just wanted to get there really quick. The trip was really exhausting but in the end eventually we got there and I was really relieved that we did. I got off the bus at the bus station and travelled to my hotel where I booked for a week. I went and the hotel was luxurious. I had no problems in the week that I stayed there as I had the experience to travel all around Cape Town by myself. Went to the clubs on long street had fun and went on different activities as well met a few people as well but towards the end of my vacation, I was involved in a car accident. No one got hurt but as I was going home in an Uber a man hit us from behind which delayed me going home but I eventually got home and that experience caused me to book a bus ticket again and come straight back home as I was traumatised.;3rd june 2023 travel cape town(the mother city expect travel plan trip time luggage bag pack set place trip book bus ticket travel instead plane way expensive bus 18 + hour cape town mind time departure bus early morning sleep early time morning 6:00am departure go sleep early wake 5:00am morning wash face brush tooth get ready trip leave shower go late decide shower hotel cape town get bus station time properly luggage seat want depart 6:00am 1 hour trip fall asleep hour trip multiple stop people want food need restroom want quick trip exhausting end eventually get relieve get bus bus station travel hotel book week go hotel luxurious problem week stay experience travel cape town go club long street fun go different activity meet people end vacation involve car accident get hurt go home uber man hit delay go home eventually get home experience cause book bus ticket come straight home traumatised;20;0.718905472636816;4.5;3.85;3.6

She was a year older than me and was starting to worry about our future together because she was about to be 30 and wanted assurance that staying in the relationship any longer would mean I was going to marry her someday. I told her that I wasn't ready to make that decision yet because of the financial situation I was in at the time and would not want to make any promises that I wouldn't be able to fulfil in the future. A couple of months later on a WhatsApp video call while she was sharing her screen a message popped up and she quickly swiped it off-screen before I could make out the words. Shortly after, another message popped up from the same person and I noticed that the person had called her ""baby"". When I confronted her about it, she told me some story about it was a guy from work with whom they playfully call each other ""baby"". I asked to see their chat and she pretended to be getting another call from her brother and quickly dropped off the call with me. When she called me back she told me that she had deleted the chat by mistake while trying to open it(insert clown face emoji). She eventually admitted that she had been cheating on me with the other guy for some months(they didn't even work together) and blamed it on my not being certain about whether or not I'd marry her and that she wanted to explore her options in finding someone serious about her.

611d64af9898c121c4cd1dd4;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;"My relationship with Tumelo started in high school, when we would visit each other often during school holidays. She was the one person I could actually see a future with. She was very smart, very caring and incredibly beautiful. However, due to long distance, our relationship would be on and off. We had drifted apart and lost touch for some time, until we rekindled in university. But upon rekindling our ""friendship"" she discovered that she was pregnant with another guy's child. That truly devastated and hurt me. Solely because I thought I would be her first, and also the realization that she had been with another man during my absence. After learning all of this, we spent some years apart and not keeping touch. I guess that gave me time to heal and forgive her. Or so I thought. On the eve of my 25th birthday we somehow attended the same work event and upon seeing her, all those feelings I had for her came flooding back. We exchanged numbers and started talking frequently. We then decided to give our relationship another chance. Her kid was all grown up at this point and he was a cute kid. But all he did was serve as a reminder of what I considered her betrayal. I didn't realize this at the time, but it made me increasingly bitter and spiteful. I would find every kind of reason to not talk about her son, or even meet the son. When I would feel those negative feelings creeping up, I would start fights and blame her for any and everything. I would gaslight her to believe that every challenge is all her fault. I wanted her to feel all those horrible feelings I felt. All those mind games were in the hopes that that she would hate herself. Our relationship quickly became emotionally abusive. And during one of our fights, she broke down and cried. I then realized how much I hadn't forgiven her, and decided to end the relationship.";relationship tumelo start high school visit school holiday person actually future smart caring incredibly beautiful long distance relationship drift apart lose touch time rekindle university rekindle friendship discover pregnant guy child truly devastate hurt solely think realization man absence learn spend year apart keep touch guess give time heal forgive think eve 25th birthday attend work event see feeling come flood exchange number start talk frequently decide relationship chance kid grow point cute kid serve reminder consider betrayal realize time increasingly bitter spiteful find kind reason talk son meet son feel negative feeling creep start fight blame gaslight believe challenge fault want feel horrible feeling feel mind game hope hate relationship quickly emotionally abusive fight break cry realize forgive decide end relationship;9;0.174041297935103;3.55555555555555;3.66666666666667;3.6666666666666665

After days of stressing, crying and being scared of telling the truth, I then shared with my mother and elder sister the stressing news, we then shared pointers and they made me realize that I did not cheat but I just had sexual encounters with my ex and a new partner days apart and hence the outcome. I them decided to come clean and let my partner know that I was unsure of the paternity of the twins, he was distraught and ended things between us right there. I spent the whole of my pregnancy alone with no one taking me to appointments and ultimately gave birth alone, we had not spoken ever since I broke the news and would only after I gave birth to provide DNA tests  which then became a reality. It was a very bitter journey and I carried guilt but also anger that he acted like I had cheated on him when he was the one I could say I cheated with as we were broken up at the time. The constant hospital admissions did not make it any easier, I guess I was stressed and hurt which made my pregnancy also at risk.

The preparations for the journey were perfect, had my visa and purchased my ticket way ahead of time in anticipation of this journey of a lifetime.
To my dismay, I nearly missed my flight as I had to say lengthy goodbyes my folk back home, who were admittedly excited for me. So I get to the check-in and it was last-call. I show up at the check-in desk all smart and smelling fresh as I was looking forward to meet my partner for the first time ever. The lady at the check-in desk was perhaps charmed by the looks of this young man who approached her- that was me. She talked to me nicely for which I also did not have a choice but to be more than nice as I had to cover up for my being late for the flight. This lady gets more and more interested in men and requested for my contact, which I handed over without hesitation, again hoping that it was what I needed to do. To my surprise, she offered to give me an upgrade to business class- boy did I love that. She escorted me to the gate since she told me I was the last passenger the crew had been waiting for. 
Off we set off for the first leg of the trip and headed to our connection. During the layover, I get a call from an unknown number and guess what, it was the lady from my earlier check-in. She said she was calling to make sure everything was going smoothly for me and that she wanted to give me directions so as to not miss my connection flight- I was delighted at her kindness. Same thing ensued when I got to my destination; she again calls to ensure I got to my destination safe and sound.
I cleared immigration hastily and rushed to me partner who was outside waiting for me the whole time. We hugged and kissed before we got a taxi and drove off home.
What made this memorable for me was the fact that not only was the flight my first, but also the upgrade to business class. I traveled like a king. 
Later, the super-nice check-in lady confessed that she had feelings for me which was such a bummer when I broke it to her that on that very journey, I was traveling to meet my partner with whom we are now happily married with kids.

This opportunity came as a result of my affiliation with one of the panel members who had advised me of the vacancy and given me tips in preparation of the interview. I had spent a period of 8 years being stagnant in the same position in my previous employer. As a result, I was willing to do anything to get a new employment elsewhere. 

This opportunity came in my life at the right time as my family and I needed a financial boost to maintain our expenses because my youngest child had just started school. So I grabbed the opportunity with both hands and I prepared using the information and tips I was given by a panel member. The interviewers had a set of three questions each and I was a bit nervous however, I had to drink water to calm my nerves. I only managed to answer 90% of the questions leaving the 10% as I did not know the answer or how to respond. 

A day later, I called the panel member to ask how everything went and to my surprise, he did not want to disclose anything and I thought to myself that I did not get the job and I have to go back to my same old job that I had been doing for the past 8 years. A month later, I decided to check my emails and to my surprise, I saw an offer letter. I was soo happy that I asked my employer to knock off early that day so that I can go celebrate with my family.

611e6b43e936390a65656ecd;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;"I still remember it like yesterday, It was Friday evening and we were drinking with my friends. My then girlfriend had went to buy a new sim-card earlier on but it was late now and she wasn't back yet. I called her friend that stays in the area she had went to. The friend blatantly told me she was in some boy's room and even went further to tell me which building and room number, at this point I felt like I could throw up my guts.

Two of my friends that were chilling with us had came with their own cars. I decided to call them outside and explain to them what was going on. We then decided to had to this place with one car. We got there and I called the friend once again, she came and she still stood her ground maintaining that my girlfriend was in that room. Upon arriving at this room we heard voices and music but when we started knocking everything went silent, we then started banging the door until it broke and there was my girlfriend with another boy in bed. 

All this was a shock, I didn't know whether to cry or laugh. All I know is that my heart was torn into a million pieces. I didn't understand how someone I loved so much, did everything for could betray me like this. My friends told me to do something, then my masculine thoughts took over. I beat that guy up and after that told my soon to be ex-girlfriend to take her stuff we're leaving.

When we got to my place she started crying before we even got to my room. My friends advised me to not believe anything she tells me and just end it. She gave me a cheap story about how she feels like I don't love her anymore and that's why she did this and that was the end of our relationship right there.

6124d4a2a63ff6077f74fac0;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;Deceptive;1;I broke my leg two days before we were set to go on holiday for three weeks. We have been planning this trip for months, as our business only allows us December's off. Like most accidents, it was unplanned and somewhat of an unnatural occurrence. Our family (myself, my husband, 4-year-old and six-year-old) was playing inside our swimming pool when I tripped in the water and snapped my leg. At first, we did not make too much of it, and thought that it was only a minor injury, perhaps that I tore a ligament or had a minor fracture. After exiting the water with the assistance of my husband and realising that I could not put any pressure on it, we knew something else was wrong. Our fears increased when we realised that I was also unable to bend or straighten my leg completely. Due to our medical fund, we were only covered at certain hospitals, and had to travel an hour from home to reach our closest ER for assistance, which was no easy task. We had to also ensure that the said hospital was a good choice and had reputable Doctors to assist us with the matter at hand. Upon arrival at the ER, I was then examined and went for multiple CT scans whereafter the Orthopaedic surgeon came in to give me the bad news. I was booked for emergency trauma surgery the following morning. Not only did I have to prep myself for a second major surgery within 9 months, but our family would also not be able to go on our long-awaited vacation that we were so looking forward too. None the less, the surgery was successful but a long, painful and traumatic recovery lied ahead, and after 5 months I am still recovering physically and mentally from this experience.;break leg day set holiday week plan trip month business allow december like accident unplanned somewhat unnatural occurrence family husband 4 year old year old play inside swimming pool trip water snap leg think minor injury tear ligament minor fracture exit water assistance husband realise pressure know wrong fear increase realise unable bend straighten leg completely medical fund cover certain hospital travel hour home reach close er assistance easy task ensure say hospital good choice reputable doctor assist matter hand arrival er examine go multiple ct scan orthopaedic surgeon come bad news book emergency trauma surgery follow morning prep second major surgery 9 month family able long await vacation look forward surgery successful long painful traumatic recovery lie ahead 5 month recover physically mentally experience;8;0.135048231511254;2.875;2.625;2.625

6452a0c8687cf626aa4dc721;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;"Missing a deadline at work because of bad organization. The main reason I missed this important deadline is because I was sent last year's calendar to measure the deadline. It only got to my attention hours before the actual deadline. Dates on the calendar change yearly, affecting the days and months. I have been working towards a false deadline, causing me to miss the actual deadline and affecting my reputation at work. Had our organizers prepared me well, I would have completed the task on time. I blame the organization for what happened. My progress has been top-standard until this incident happened and I haven't been the same ever since. I am very strict regarding delivery at work, I put my work first before anything else. This has never happened to me in the past, and I definitely won't allow it to happen again. I always respect time, and all those who live around me can attest to that statement. Iam an honest and hard-working person, my work speaks for itself. There is no way I can be held accountable for a mistake made by the organization. All the organization had to do was use a current updated calendar. The organization owes me an apology, stating the cause of the problem and how they going to assist me in fixing the problem. I would like the organization to implement a system to prevent that big mistake from happening again. i would never lie about a serious situation like this one, especially one that could cost the company millions. A problem that could have easily been avoided. A lesson learned from the side is to always double-check if dates are correct before I work towards a deadline. I have maintained a good reputation at work, and I am loved for that, but to see my name in the ""FAILED TO FINISH ON DEADLINE"" list was the pits for me. The company is at fault not me. I don't like how this whole situation has made me feel, and how it has created trust issues between me and managers. Years and years have passed and this hasn't happened to anyone in my department. It's a complete shock to me and my colleagues. If the organization does this to me again, I have no choice but to change jobs for better management. Bad organization also affects my well-being causing me stress and worry a lot which leaves me in a bad state. I need an organized team that respects time and clients. Good communication plays a big role when it comes to working with big teams, and a small communication error can cause damage that is bigger than expected, which is why such mistakes should be avoided by all means necessary. I'm a person who pays attention to detail because it's important to do so in the workplace. The organization tempered with the dates and confused me and other workers in the same department.

616cb6dee8a5f97dcce06142;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;How I ended a 1 year long relationship due to finding out my boyfriend cheated on me with a work colleague. My ex-boyfriend and I met at a friend's wedding in which I was a bridesmaid, and he was a groomsman. My ex-boyfriend had sent me a friend request a year ago on Facebook but never made a move until we attended the wedding together. I liked him the moment I received his friend request, and always wondered why he never tried to message me. Moving along to the wedding weekend where we would travel together for our friend's destination wedding, we were on the same flight but different seats. As we were waiting for checked-in luggage I met him and a close buddy of his for the first time, I felt as if though he looked younger than what I expected but as we drove down to the destination from the airport, we all got to know another and both of them were such gentlemen. When we arrived back from the wedding, he would constantly make an effort to message me and we would message back and forth until he decided to drop off flowers for Valentine's Day and once, he arrived home we immediately told each other we liked one another and started dating. We spent so much time together, went on fun dates and he met my family. But unfortunately, he never took me to meet his parents as we not following the same religion. My family would constantly ask about the relationship because they know how women are treated when they date a man following this religion. It got to a point where I was under pressure as my family felt like the relationship would not work. So, I had planned that I would somehow end things soon and to my surprise we were driving together in his car when he got a call from a girl he had worked with. He answered the call and the girl asked where he was and if his in our hometown and he responded yes and immediately dropped the call. I immediately became suspicious as someone that had nothing to hide would continue the conversation and allow the girl to ask the questions she wanted to ask. So, my boyfriend would constantly mention this girl while we were in conversation he spoke a lot about her, what she was doing, where she was, basically her name would always come up. I asked him about the call why the girl was calling him and the nature of their relationship, he kept denying that they were in contact, and I immediately didn't believe anything he said because no one is going to keep mentioning someone if you too are not intrigued by them or interested in them. I had planned a group trip with friends to a coastal area for a week, while I was on my trip I had planned due to the situation of my boyfriend not being honest with me that I would break up with him and while on my trip I did exactly that. he tried to reach out to me for about a month and I didn't feel the need to contact or engage in conversation because this girl would too heart all his posts on social media. I gave him an opportunity to be honest and he chose not to be honest, so there was nothing else to further discuss.;end 1 year long relationship find boyfriend cheat work colleague ex boyfriend meet friend wedding bridesmaid groomsman ex boyfriend send friend request year ago facebook attend wedding like moment receive friend request wonder try message move wedding weekend travel friend destination wedding flight different seat wait check luggage meet close buddy time feel look young expect drive destination airport get know gentleman arrive wedding constantly effort message message forth decide drop flower valentine day arrive home immediately tell like start date spend time go fun date meet family unfortunately take meet parent follow religion family constantly ask relationship know woman treat date man follow religion get point pressure family feel like relationship work plan end thing soon surprise drive car get girl work answer girl ask hometown respond yes immediately drop immediately suspicious hide continue conversation allow girl ask question want ask boyfriend constantly mention girl conversation speak lot basically come ask girl call nature relationship keep deny contact immediately believe say go mention intrigue interested plan group trip friend coastal area week trip plan situation boyfriend honest break trip exactly try reach month feel need contact engage conversation girl heart post social medium give opportunity honest choose honest discuss;6;0.047945205479452;2.83333333333333;3.0;3.8333333333333335

I took the same bus as always and I buy tickets almost all the time, to have a peace of mind. This time I simply forgot, because I was watching an interesting video on YouTube. I did not see the controllers at all. I tried to buy an online ticket, but he said to me to not bother, because the time would be off. It was then I noticed it was actually a three controllers - one went from the back of the bus, one from font and one from middle. The one from middle pinned me down on my spot, even tough I was sitting near the door and could eventually run off, as there were many chances, I simply did not, I wanted to apologize and resolve it with them. They wanted my ID and I immediately handed it to them, but I have mentioned that I buy tickets every time and I have sipmly forgotten this time. It was three relatively young and intelligent gentlemen. They wanted to let me off without a fine, but they could not because the incident was on the camera. But they mentioned, that if I buy ticket card for 150€ at the spot, I will not get the fine. I was really happy and accepted the terms as I did not know about the card and the option. I went off the bus pleasantly surprised about the whole experience, as the controllers were really nice and now I had a card valid for one year.;bus go home work 17:30 calm city take bus buy ticket time peace mind time simply forget watch interesting video youtube controller try buy online ticket say bother time notice actually controller go bus font middle middle pin spot tough sit near door eventually run chance simply want apologize resolve want id immediately hand mention buy ticket time sipmly forget time relatively young intelligent gentleman want let fine incident camera mention buy ticket card 150 € spot fine happy accept term know card option go bus pleasantly surprise experience controller nice card valid year;9;0.766666666666667;3.44444444444445;2.77777777777778;1.0
61116b31cf2d27f9ce7b3f57;Ending a long romantic relationship;Deceptive;1;My boyfriend and I have been a little distant lately. I felt that he was pulling away, to which I said 'Nice, more time for myself'. I trusted him and believed in our relationship, I knew it was just a phase and that we would find our ways back to each other eventually. I'd be lying if I said I didn't worry at all though. Sometimes I'd have moments where I'd get very tense and anxious about the future of our relationship. I was worried he had got sick of me, that something was wrong. Then he invited me to dinner one night. He wanted to take me to the restaurant where we had our very first date. I though 'Okay, no one would break up where we first met, right? This has to be a new beginning.'  Our anniversary was coming up in a month. I couldn't help but feel quite a bit of tension between us that day though. We ended up going to a different place because I had to work at a different site than usual, and they informed right before my shift. After dinner, as we were sitting in the middle of the restaurant, he held my hand, looked deep into my eyes, and said he needed a break from the relationship. His reasons didn't make any sense, they seemed make-shift excuses. He was unnecessarily harsh and instantly got deffensive when I tried reasoning with him. I told him not to be a coward and just break up with me for good. That I didn't wanna be with someone who'd want a break from me, especially when we've been giving each other more space already. I was hurt and terrified of losing him deep inside, but stood up for myself, because I knew my worth and that I deserve someone who truly appreciates me. I told him it was just his dismissive avoidant attachment style kicking in, and there's nothing I can do, so he should sleep on it and if he really wants to lose me, then fine. I stood up from the table, grabbed my things, said good-bye and stormed out of the restaurant. He ran after me asking me to wait, but I just said 'Sleep on it, we'll talk tomorrow!' and kept going. The next day he came to me with a potted plant as a gift, the kind I had been eyeing for a while. He apologized and said he was acting on an impulse, and that he has reconsidered and didn't wanna lose me. We both knew it was going to be hard, but decided to give it a shot. He started therapy the week after, and we still have arguments, but are working through our issues.;boyfriend little distant lately feel pull away say nice time trust believe relationship know phase find way eventually lie say worry moment tense anxious future relationship worried get sick wrong invite dinner night want restaurant date okay break meet right new beginning anniversary come month help feel bit tension day end go different place work different site usual inform right shift dinner sit middle restaurant hold hand look deep eye say need break relationship reason sense shift excuse unnecessarily harsh instantly get deffensive try reason tell coward break good wanna want break especially give space hurt terrify lose deep inside stand know worth deserve truly appreciate tell dismissive avoidant attachment style kick sleep want lose fine stand table grab thing say good bye storm restaurant run ask wait say sleep talk tomorrow keep go day come pot plant gift kind eye apologize say act impulse reconsider wanna lose know go hard decide shot start therapy week argument work issue;12;0.411016949152542;3.75;3.16666666666667;3.4166666666666665

One lady collapsed just before my and my partner's feet so I could quickly grab her before she fell to the floor. We then lifted her onto the stretcher and begun the walk to medical care 300 meters away. It was quite tireing and my partner's grip weakened so much that we had to put down the stretcher for a short momentarily relief before we got there. When we finally got there, we could deliver her to the prepared medicians without any delay as I had been able to call them while carrying the stretcher.;help local 10 k race duty carry collapse runner stretcher nearby medical care lady collapse partner foot quickly grab fall floor lift stretcher begin walk medical care 300 meter away tire partner grip weaken stretcher short momentarily relief get finally get deliver prepared medicians delay able carry stretcher;2;0.180327868852459;3.5;3.5;5.0
60da1362fe5b7aee2580c5a7;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;As a dedicated fifth year medical student, I have always strived to meet the intensity and demands of my coursework with diligence and responsibility. However, last year, I faced an unexpected challenge that resulted in me missing a crucial assignment deadline. Despite my best efforts and careful planning, circumstances beyond my control prevented me from completing the assignment on time. the experience highlighted the unpredictable nature of life and the importance of adaptability in the face of unforeseen events. However, as the deadline approached, a series of unexpected events disturbed my meticulously planned schedule. Firstly, a sudden family emergency demanded my immediate attention and presence, significantly reducing the time I could dedicate to my studies. This emergency was unavoidable and took precedence over my academic responsibilities, as family well-being is paramount. Simultaneously, a technical issue with my laptop added to the chaos. Just days before the submission date, my laptop malfunctioned, resulting in the loss of critical data and research materials. Despite my best attempts to recover the lost work and the hours spent trying to fix the issue, the technical failure proved insurmountable within the limited time available. The setback was compounded by the fact that access to university resources and support was limited due to ongoing pandemic-related restrictions. Additionally, an unexpected health issue further complicated the situation. I fell ill with a severe flu, which rendered me physically incapable of focusing on my studies for several days. This illness was an unforeseen obstacle that drastically reduced my productivity and ability to complete the assignment as planned. Despite these challenges, I communicated promptly with my professors, explaining the situation and seeking possible extensions or accommodations. Their understanding and support underscored the importance of open communication and the recognition that sometimes, even the best laid out plans can be derailed by circumstances beyond our control.;dedicated fifth year medical student strive meet intensity demand coursework diligence responsibility year face unexpected challenge result miss crucial assignment deadline despite good effort careful planning circumstance control prevent complete assignment time experience highlight unpredictable nature life importance adaptability face unforeseen event deadline approach series unexpected event disturb meticulously plan schedule firstly sudden family emergency demand immediate attention presence significantly reduce time dedicate study emergency unavoidable take precedence academic responsibility family paramount simultaneously technical issue laptop add chaos day submission date laptop malfunction result loss critical datum research material despite good attempt recover lose work hour spend try fix issue technical failure prove insurmountable limited time available setback compound fact access university resource support limit ongoing pandemic relate restriction additionally unexpected health issue complicate situation fall ill severe flu render physically incapable focus study day illness unforeseen obstacle drastically reduce productivity ability complete assignment plan despite challenge communicate promptly professor explain situation seek possible extension accommodation understanding support underscore importance open communication recognition well lay plan derail circumstance control;8;0.41042345276873;4.125;2.625;1.75

I was dating a girl her name was Zesipho who i have been in a relationship with for about 2 years at the time of the event. I was at my home village maluti and she was also at her village. 

Earlier that day she had told me that she was going to attend church together with her younger sister, mother and grandmother. i told her that she would call me after church if she is not busy. Then after church she didn't call me so i thought that she was busy or mybe even sleeping as she once told me that he church was very far. 

I have a relative that lives in the same village as her and her name is Asanda she is my aunt 35 years old. later the day i received a call from her telling me that there is something important she wants to tell me. she said that she saw my girlfriend cheating on me with another boy on her way back to school. She said they first kissed each other in the near by river and they went to the boys home where they spend hours inside. She proceeded by sending me pictures of them together there was no picture of the them kissing or holding hands like she said. nor the picture where they entered the boy's house.

At that point i was a bit worried but i didn't fully trust my aunt as i know she likes to randomly lie sometimes. After that i the called my girlfriend and asked her where was she after church she told me that she just fell asleep after she got home and forgot to tell me. showed her pictures sent to me by my aunt and asked who was that boy she was with. She said that was her big brother and that where did i take the picture i said to her that it does matter where i got the pictures but i knew she was cheating and someone saw them. before she should even respond i blocked her and continued with my life.";day 7 january 2024 sunday event happe late day 7 pm date girl zesipho relationship 2 year time event home village maluti village early day tell go attend church young sister mother grandmother tell church busy church think busy mybe sleep tell church far relative live village asanda aunt 35 year old later day receive tell important want tell say see girlfriend cheat boy way school say kiss near river go boy home spend hour inside proceed send picture picture kiss hold hand like say picture enter boy house point bit worried fully trust aunt know like randomly lie call girlfriend ask church tell fall asleep get home forget tell show picture send aunt ask boy say big brother picture say matter get picture know cheat see respond block continue life;6;0.711229946524064;4.33333333333333;3.16666666666667;3.3333333333333335
661624e5595c233a68a3963b;Missing a deadline at work because of bad organisation;Deceptive;1;"I was given a specific task at work by a consultant of our company who is also a university professor. It was a pretty menial task, transfer the information from some old slides to a Word document, which would be used as an e-book guide for employees, and then create some new, clean, slideshows with the updated info. This was a job done in favor of another company. A certain percentage of the task had already been done by someone else previously, around the holidays, specifically Christmas time, but the professor had forgotten about it, and therefore, when the task was given to me, he assumed 2-3 days would be enough to complete it as the deadline to submit it to the other organization was during those days.
Unfortunately, his calculation was off, even though the task was pretty simple and I got on it immediately, recreating some of the visuals and making sure everything looked right and clean was more time consuming than he initially thought. I even had a second person come on board to help out, and we still ended up needing 2-3 extra days to complete it all as the e-book was pretty big. Aside from that, as the other person was completely inexperienced using the office suite and it was the first time they were using it, I had to often correct their mistakes, which meant extra work for myself in the end. I was even blamed by the professor for missing some details, and he said I should have been more attentive as this would be the final deliverable, even though he initially gave us such a short time frame to complete it all but still expected perfection, he also wasn't aware of the extra mistakes I had to correct thanks to the other person.";give specific task work consultant company university professor pretty menial task transfer information old slide word document e book guide employee create new clean slideshow update info job favor company certain percentage task previously holiday specifically christmas time professor forget task give assume 2 3 day complete deadline submit organization day unfortunately calculation task pretty simple get immediately recreate visual make sure look right clean time consume initially think second person come board help end need 2 3 extra day complete e book pretty big aside person completely inexperienced office suite time correct mistake mean extra work end blame professor miss detail say attentive final deliverable initially give short time frame complete expect perfection aware extra mistake correct thank person;1;0.0196078431372549;3.0;3.0;1.0

It happened 1 month ago because he was feeling tired, short of breath and in pain from having 5 broken ribs. One day, while coughing, he became so short of breath that we had to call an emergency ambulance to take him to the hospital and admit him. They did breathing tests, put him on oxygen masks and did rehabilitation so that he could breathe better and not feel so much fatigue. He underwent surgery to remove fluid from the pleura and all symptoms subsided. Now he is at home recovering from the after-effects, but his mood is improving and his physical condition is improving as well. In fact, he is doing sports little by little as a hobby and, by the way, gaining lung capacity to improve his quality of life after the traumatic shock of having been hospitalized for about 1 month. He even lives a normal life, as before he was admitted and had pneumonia, in fact, he does things like when he was young and was not yet a smoker.

A truck came at us at high speed, flashing its lights, which caused my boyfriend to quickly move into the left-hand lane. However, the truck passed us on the right (which is not correct in our country) and hit our side mirror. We went after the truck to get its license plate so that we could later file a complaint and get him/her to pay the costs of the damage it had done.
I was very frightened by the situation, as it could have led to a crash and a serious accident. We drove for over an hour without the help of the mirror, which was also quite dangerous and difficult given the weather conditions at the time. It was very stessful. We had just taken out a new insurance policy for the car, so we also remembered the situation more easily.";remember leave braga rainy night get highway head home boyfriend drive car truck come high speed flash light cause boyfriend quickly left hand lane truck pass right correct country hit mirror go truck license plate later file complaint pay cost damage frightened situation lead crash accident drive hour help mirror dangerous difficult give weather condition time stessful take new insurance policy car remember situation easily;3;0.251428571428571;3.33333333333333;4.0;3.0
